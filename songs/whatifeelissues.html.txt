I'm sick and tired of the games you played<br>
Every move I make your ass got something to say<br>
Scandalize my name when you see it in the paper<br>
Trying to turn it all around when it wasn't that way<br>
Everybody is trying to figure me out<br>
What the hell is wrong with y'all just let me live my life<br>
I can't go one day without y'all in my face<br>
Y'all done lost y'all minds if you don't hear what I say<br>
Cops chase me when I'm standing still<br>
You know I ain't done shit wrong so why you want me in your cell<br>
You don't like my songs well it pays the bills<br>
And you cut me down cuz I keep it real<br>
Sometimes I wanna fly far away from here<br>
To another place it ain't worth these tears<br>
Sometimes at night when I close my eyes<br>
I know the haters are busy making up hater lies<br>
Sometimes I laugh trying to keep from crying<br>
If I was plain out of love then tell me who could I trust<br>
See I work so hard just to get ahead<br>
If it wasn't for God I'd probably be dead<br>
Sometimes I think y'all trying to pull me down<br>
But y'all wasting your time I got you haters figured out<br>
If yo had your way it'd be lock and key<br>
Everywhere I go trouble follows me<br>
Where the hell is my father shit it hurts sometimes<br>
There's a hole in me and it rocks my mind<br>
<br>
Forgive me father for I have sinned<br>
When was your last confession<br>
<br>
His true fears he left without a care<br>
And that was more than I could bare<br>
When you need my help I never tell you no<br>
When I need your love you got somewhere to go<br>
I'm getting sick of this shit but I'm not gonna quit<br>
I've come too far gotta keep my pockets thick<br>
I get mad as hell but that's ok<br>
Kick off these shoes cuz I'm here to stay<br>
I gotta let you know got no time to play<br>
So feel me and all that you hear me say<br>
What I'm building up you can't tear it down<br>
Cuz it's built on solid Rockland ground<br>
We don't die, we multiply, hit after hit, living platinum style<br>
Keep my head up high, looking toward the sky<br>
Nothing inmy view, hey I can fly<br>
Y'all just hate, I can't take no more<br>
And if you feel me raise your hand and show<br>
<br>
This is what I feel, ooh, this is what I feel<br>
Feel me, feel me, feel me, hey, hey feel, woo<br>
Westside tell me can you feel me, hey, oh<br>
Eastside tell me can you feel me, whoa, oh south<br>
Southside tell me can you feel me<br>
Feel me, feel me
