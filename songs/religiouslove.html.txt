Dearly beloved, why did you go<br>
When being with you forever is all I hope<br>
Slowly the rain is falling in our home<br>
Come back and start right from going wrong<br>
I'll be still until I hear from you<br>
And I'll be waiting until you return this message<br>
<br>
A religious love for you baby<br>
Every night I pray <br>
That heaven will send you back to me<br>
Baby you're all I ever needed <br>
Religious love for ya baby<br>
Every night I pray <br>
That someday I'll have you for my wife<br>
Baby you are my life, please believe me<br>
<br>
For only God knows how much I miss you<br>
And for us to be one it takes two<br>
So don't you go dying on me not right now<br>
Please change the impossible to somehow<br>
I'll be still there until I hear from you<br>
And I'll be praying until you return this message<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
In the middle of the night, I'll be callin' you<br>
Every single breath I take I hope to see you there<br>
If you should ever need, if ever you need a friend<br>
Baby I am here and don't forget to remember me<br>
<br>
Oh baby, come to me - don't leave me lonely<br>
I need you here with me so return this message<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
