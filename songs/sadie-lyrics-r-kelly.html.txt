This song goes out to my mother
The one I love and the one I lost
When it comes down to her
Thinkin' about what my mother's done for me
The love she's given me It makes it easy to do some thing like this So this
one's for you ma I love you
Early one Sunday morning Breakfast was on the table There was no time to eat
She said to me, "Boy hurry to Sunday school"
Filled with the long of glory We learned the holy story She'll always have her
dreams Despite the things this troubled world can bring
Oh Sadie, don't you know we love you sweet Sadie Place no one above you sweet
Sadie Well well well Living in the past
Sometimes it seems so funny No money can turn your life around Sweeter than
cotton candy Stronger than papas' old brandy Always that needed smile Once in
awhile she would break down and cry
Sometimes she'd be so happy Being with us and daddy Standing the worst of times
Breaking the binds with just a simple song
Oh Sadie maiden She's loving my song in a special way Well, well, well Sweet
Sadie Living in the past
Oh she's never sinning In love she's always winning yeah My my my my my I Love
you mama
I just can't forget how you gave me love, oh no If there's a Heaven up above I
know she's teaching angels how to love Its a mean world without you And I
surely miss you much mother
And now that your gone I'm gonna carry on 'Cause your cryin' lady, woh Sadie
When I think about the things that you done for me Hey it brings a joy way down
deep inside of me, yeah woh
See I love you mama Yes I do I'll never forget you mother No oh ho, no oh ho
