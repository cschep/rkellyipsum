Yo, what's up baby?<br>
I don't see no sign on my door that says it's closed<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
Step in my room<br>
'Cause I got a little something for you baby<br>
In my room<br>
And I know you're gonna like it baby<br>
Step in my room<br>
'Cause I got a little something for you baby<br>
In my room<br>
<br>
Finally we're all alone<br>
So lock the doors and unplug the phone<br>
I wanna take you where passion lies<br>
Girl you want my lovin', I can see it in your eyes<br>
Baby don't hold back the feelin'<br>
Just bring your body to me<br>
And I'm gonna give you everything you need<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
<br>
Makin' sweet love 'til morning comes<br>
Still lovin' you after it's said and done<br>
And doin' those things you want me to do to you baby<br>
Like goin' down on you by the fireplace<br>
Baby don't hold back the feelin'<br>
Just bring that body to me<br>
And I'm gonna give you everything you need<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
<br>
Hey there lady, you drive me crazy<br>
Sexy lady, you drive me crazy<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
