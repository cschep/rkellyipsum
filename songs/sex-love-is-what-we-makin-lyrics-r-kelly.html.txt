I can not believe that it's goin' on the 3rd day
No need for a clock 'cause baby girl we wont stop
Got me wantin' to keep on goin', every since the pants drop
We been making out for a quite while Unbelievable how we drive each other wild

Sex in the morning, sex in the evening Sex in the noon day even when we
sleeping I want sex on all the holidays and every single weekend Baby it's so
okay because love is what we making
Well take our time 'cause girl we got our whole life Your sex is incredible
