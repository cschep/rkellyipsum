There is strength deep inside me
That I never knew I had
There's a fire within burnin' bright
There is a love inside of me
That I never thought I'd feel Until the day you came into my life, yeah
And it was you that were there When no one else was And you show me a love
unknown, ooh
You kept the fire burnin' You kept hope alive And when my soul was fallin' You
helped me to survive And you led the way Encouraged me to take that leap of
faith
There's a dream that I dream But never knew it would come true There's a place
I never thought that I would be, ooh There is a chance that I took That I never
thought I'd take Until you came and helped me to believe, oh
You were there When no one else was And you showed me a love unknown
You kept the fire burnin' And you kept hope alive And when my soul was fallin'
You helped me to survive And you led the way Encouraged me to take that leap of
faith Leap of faith, oh yeah, oh oh
You showed me just how How to believe in me, in me, oh You moved that tree And
tore that forest there for me
You kept the fire burnin' You kept hope alive And when my soul was fallin' You
helped me to survive You led the way Encouraged me to take the leap of faith,
yeah
You kept the fire burnin' You kept hope alive And when my soul was fallin' You
helped me to survive You led the way Encouraging me to take
The fire, hope, soul with you You, you led, encouraged me That leap of faith
and make it over Now I owe my thanks to you, oh, oh
You kept the fire burnin' You kept hope alive And when my soul was fallin' You
helped me to survive Oh yes, you did Pushing me to take that leap of faith
You kept the fire burnin' You kept hope alive And when my soul was fallin' You
helped me to survive, oh
