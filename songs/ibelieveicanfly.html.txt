I used to think that I could not go on<br>
And life was nothing but an awful song<br>
But now I know the meaning of true love<br>
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms<br>
<br>
If I can see it, then I can do it<br>
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br>
I believe I can fly<br>
I believe I can touch the sky<br>
I think about it every night and day<br>
Spread my wings and fly away<br>
I believe I can soar<br>
I see me running through that open door<br>
I believe I can fly<br>
I believe I can fly<br>
I believe I can fly<br>
<br>
See I was on the verge of breaking down<br>
Sometimes silence can seem so loud<br>
There are miracles in life I must achieve<br>
But first I know it starts inside of me, oh<br>
<br>
If I can see it, then I can be it<br>
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
<br>
Hey, cause I believe in me, oh<br>
<br>
If I can see it, then I can be it<br>
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
<br>
Hey, if I just spread my wings<br>
I can fly<br>
I can fly<br>
I can fly, hey<br>
If I just spread my wings<br>
I can fly<br>
Fly-eye-eye
