I am a mountain I am a tall tree Ohhh, I am a swift wind Sweepin' the country I
am a river Down in the valley Ohhh, I am a vision And I can see clearly If
anybody asks u who I am Just stand up tall look 'em in the Face and say
I'm that star up in the sky I'm that mountain peak up high Hey, I made
it I'm the worlds greatest And I'm that little bit of hope When my backs
against the ropes I can feel it mmm I'm the worlds greatest
I am a giant I am an eagle I am a lion Down in the jungle I am a marchin' band
I am the people I am a helpin' hand And I am a hero If anybody asks u who I am
Just stand up tall look 'em in the Face and say
I'm that star up in the sky I'm that mountain peak up high I made it
I'm the worlds greatest And I'm that little bit of hope When my backs against
the ropes I can feel it I'm the worlds greatest
In the ring of life I'll reign love And the world will notice a king When all
is darkest, I'll shine a light And use a success you'll find in me

I'm that star up in the sky I'm that mountain peak up high Hey, I made it I'm
the world's greatest And I'm that little bit of hope When my back's against the
ropes I can feel it I'm the world's greatest
I'm that star up in the sky I'm that mountain peak up high Hey, I made it I'm
the world's greatest And I'm that little bit of hope When my back's against the
ropes I can feel it I'm the world's greatest
I'm that star up in the sky I'm that mountain peak up high Hey, I made it I'm
the world's greatest And I'm that little bit of hope When my back's against the
ropes I can feel it I'm the world's greatest
It's the greatest Can you feel it It's the greatest Can you feel it
I saw the light At the end of a tunnel Believe in the pot of
gold At the end of the rainbow And faith was right there To pull me through,
yeah Used to be locked doors Now I can just walk on through Hey, uh, hey, hey,
hey It's the greatest I'm that star up in the sky
I'm that star up in the sky I'm that mountain peak up high Hey, I made it I'm
the world's greatest And I'm that little bit of hope When my back's against the
ropes I can feel it I'm the world's greatest
