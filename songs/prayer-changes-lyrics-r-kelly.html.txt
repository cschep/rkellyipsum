Now I was in a real bad abusive relationship Knowing that, there was no way for
me to live A young girl like me, raised up in a good family Way too young to
endure such misery And every night I cry myself to sleep from all the pain And
the more I prayed for sunny days it seemed to rain
(He hit me) At any given time (He hit me) No reason at all (He hit me) So, so
hard (He hit me) My God, sometimes I'd fall
Mama asked what happened to me and I'd take up for him She said that devil's a
liar and pray get rid of him And now I'm going to school, hitting those books

I was a freshman in college and uh I had just made it on the basketball team I
had all the skills it took to make it But on my grades, I would get nothing but
all D's And the coach came to me And had a talk with me about my career
Said if you don't get your grades up I'm gonna have to sit you down this year
Man as tough as I was, I break down and cried 'Cause everybody knows me Knows
that basketball is my life
(Algebra) I studied hard (Chemistry) I gave my all (Calculus) Oh my God
(English) So many flaws
Playing ball didn't look to good for me My future, could not see, I had lost
all my beliefs And gave up on all my dreams Then I went to church on Sunday And
the pastor began to preach It was like he was talking to me When he said, I can
do all things
In Christ that strengthens me and for me that was enough Now that I went from a
D all the way to an A plus I tell you prayer changes things

Me and my wife had a few problems We thought that nothing could solve them
Listening to family members and so called friends Man I tell you that's just
how the devil creeps in
We were separated at least for a month or two She was wilding in the clubs And
I was out there doing wrong too And we would walk around the house Putting each
other down I mean right in front of the kids We would curse each other out
Then I was in a bad accident and almost lost my life And guess who was there
for me, my wife Now ain't it funny how He makes a way When we said there was no
way I'm out the hospital and back at home Planning another wedding day, I tell
you

Now all of these things were happening in one family But that's okay, 'cause
there's nothing God can't achieve I don't care what the problem in your life
may be 'Cause who the Son sets free, is free indeed And if you didn't know, now
you should know All you got to do is take this family's life for example
