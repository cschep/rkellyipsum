I'm still fresh like, uh, Impala, uh Dre's young guns, still ridin', the base
drums Four times platinum, hate it or love it, I'm still number one
Still in the hood one hand on my gun And my trigger finger still make bitches

Layin' back in the chair, while you wind it Lap dance on me girl, bump and

hot
