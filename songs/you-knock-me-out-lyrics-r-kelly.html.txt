You got, you got, you got
Come on baby and show me what you got
Come on baby
(Don't be shy, no, don't be shy)
Let the music hypnotize you
You got me feelin' good From head to feet like I knew you would Baby, Heaven
must have broken the fall 'Cause girl your love is out of control
And it's caught up in you 'Cause don't, don't nobody do me like you do, yeah
You hit me You knock me out Yeah, you hit me You knock me out
And it's caught up in you 'Cause don't know nobody do me like you do
Come on, come on baby Come on, come on baby Come on (Dance with me baby, dance
with me baby) Oh, come on baby
Like the father's house on Sunday morn You give me joy Like victory after the
war I'm comin' home baby to ya girl
In this corner in you 'Cause can't nobody do me like you do
You hit me Said, you knock me out You hit me Girl, you knock me out
In this corner in you (I'm the champ) 'Cause can't nobody do me like you do
Dance with me baby Dance with me baby Dance with me baby Dance with me baby
Come on dance with me baby
Listen to me Hey, listen to me Ooh, the melody Oh girl, it's you 'Cause can't
nobody do me like you do
You hit me Girl, you knock me out Yes, you did You hit me Oh baby You knock me
out
In this corner in you (I'm the champ) 'Cause can't nobody do me like you do
Like a speed train in the way You hit me baby You knock me out
