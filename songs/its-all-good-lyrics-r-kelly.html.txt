Another one of those Trackmasters
Rockland joints, you know what I'm saying?

Since conversation's not the same And he turned in some shine to rain Well boo,
I'm gonna ease your pain Because I'm gonna be your man
It's all good, see you've already been through enough, baby It's all good,
that's why things are about to swing your way It's all good, you see you don't
have to worry baby It's all good 'cause tomorrow's sun is gonna bring a
brighter day
Yes, we gon' hit the shopping strip I'll buy you anything you want You deserve
a first class trip Somewhere far away from home
It's all good, see you've already been through enough, baby It's all good,
that's why things are about to swing your way It's all good, you see you don't
have to worry baby It's all good 'cause tomorrow's sun is gonna bring a
brighter day
Free your mind and I'll lead you to place Where the wind blows and your cares I
cast away and it's all good
Come on, come on, yo Yo dippin' in the six with the top let down Smirk on my
face 'cause I'm Rockland bound While on the other side of town
I be holding it down Wearing brigets around on my platinum crown Y'all wanna
see my business clothes See me fold
Keep me from rocking the white gold Bitches hail, when I roll we'll sit on
chrome When we do shows we sell out super domes While you at home burning the
hot coal
Honey, left you coming home to me like it's a curfew One nice day and now she
calling me boo And she calling you through And you calling me singing the sad
tune
I wish Kelly would pick up the celly Got a Philly in a telly with cramps in her
belly Now, I can get freaky with some K-Y-jelly But I'd rather go cruise with
my man, what the deally?
It's all good, see you've already been through enough, baby It's all good,
that's why things are about to swing your way It's all good, you see you don't
have to worry baby It's all good 'cause tomorrow's sun is gonna bring a
brighter day
It's all good, see I just want to see you happy darling It's all good, yeah and
I can't stand to see your eyes crying It's all good and if it takes the rest of
all my life It's all good, your whole world's gonna be a paradise, it's all
good
Rockland, Trackmasters, Nine-Eight You suckers, screw all of y'all
