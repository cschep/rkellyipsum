<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br>
Mmmmm.. ohhhh, ohhhohhhhh<br>
Oooohhh.. ohhh no, mmmmm<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus: R. Kelly + (Jay-Z)*]</i><br>
You and me, havin sex<br>
After an argument, that shit's the best<br>
You and me, havin sex yeahh<br>
After an argument, that shit's the best<br>
(Think about it while the streets you roam<br>
 It's Dom P and Army in the fridge when you get home)<br>
<br>
<i>[*overlapping R's last line]</i><br>
<br>
I storm in, she storm out<br>
It's like the "War of the Roses" goin on in my house<br>
It's a little seperation but I know how to fix the situation<br>
Mami just sufferin from love deprevation<br>
So I gotta give her thug reperations<br>
Put it in the life until love leg is shakin<br>
Slow and passionate, 'til we forget what happens<br>
Then we laughin and we back friends<br>
<br>
<i>[Interlude: R. Kelly]</i><br>
You don't have to fuss and fight<br>
Why don't you just spend the night<br>
Baby let's just kiss and hug<br>
You know the words girl let's make up<br>
So much love to be made<br>
Instead of screamin, "Who's to blame?"<br>
Girl I don't wanna.. let you go, I need you so<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
<br>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br>
Girlfriend didn't believe me when I said I'd be back in a little<br>
Cause I had the Chris T on with the crease in the middle<br>
Plus a fresh cut and the freezin icicles<br>
on my wrist, on my hand, that's when shit hit the fan<br>
Said, "You never spend timey, what's up with that?"<br>
Translated it means<br>
<i>[R]</i> Hit it hard from the back<br>
Yeah she hid my car keys<br>
And forced me to fall asleep to her heartbeat<br>
<br>
<i>[Interlude]</i><br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus w/o Jay-Z]</i><br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br>
I don't want.. baby I don't want to fight<br>
I just wanna make it right (ooh yeah)<br>
Put out problems to the side<br>
Let's just make sweet love tonight (I don't want)<br>
Baby I don't want to fight<br>
I just wanna make it right (ohhhhh love)<br>
Put our problems to the side<br>
Let's just make sweet love tonight<br>
<br>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br>
Sex so intense, all that's on my mind<br>
It ain't feel this good since the very first time<br>
I'm pullin her close, she's pullin away<br>
I'm tryin to kiss her mouth but she keeps turnin her face<br>
Cute sex game like our very first date<br>
We ain't know each other well enough, we had to wait<br>
But oh!  I know just where your hot spot at<br>
You can not deny that, so do not try that<br>
I do not buy that..<br>
<br>
