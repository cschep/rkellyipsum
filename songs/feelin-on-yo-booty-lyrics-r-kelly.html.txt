This is my song for real, no doubt
Said the DJ's makin' me feel tugged out
As I walk you to the dance floor
We begin' to dance slow
Put your arms around me I'm feelin' on your booty
Hey, pretty mama how you doin'? Said I'm just in town for the weekend Lookin'
for a little trouble to get into Baby tell me what you're drinkin'? And I got
you
Players wanna play Ballers wanna ball Rollers wanna roll But I'm takin' off
after I dance, oh yeah
This is my song for real, no doubt Said the DJ's makin' me feel tugged out As I
walk you to the dance floor We begin to dance slow Put your arms around me I'm
feelin' on your booty
This is my song for real, no doubt Said the DJ's makin' me feel tugged out As I
walk you to the dance floor We begin to dance slow Put your arms around me I'm
feelin' on your booty
Now you're body's got me feelin' like spendin' With a back room I could come to
live in And your hair weave lookin' kind of pretty The way you back it up on me
baby God have mercy
Players wanna play Ballers wanna ball Rollers wanna roll But I'm takin' off
after I dance, yeah
This is my song for real, no doubt Said the DJ's makin' me feel tugged out As I
walk you to the dance floor We begin to dance slow Put your arms around me I'm
feelin' on your booty
This is my song for real, no doubt Said the DJ's makin' me feel tugged out As I
walk you to the dance floor We begin to dance slow Put your arms around me I'm
feelin' on your booty
If it's your birthday Then put your hands up You wanna get drunk Then put your
hands up And if you got some cash Put your hands up And your own job Put your
hands up
Players wanna play Ballers wanna ball Rollers wanna roll Feel so good, say it
again Players wanna play Ballers wanna ball Rollers wanna roll But I'm takin'
off after I dance, oh yeah
This is my song for real, no doubt Said the DJ's makin' me feel tugged out As I
walk you to the dance floor We begin to dance slow Put your arms around me I'm
feelin' on your booty
This is my song for real, no doubt Said the DJ's makin' me feel tugged out As I
walk you to the dance floor We begin to dance slow Put your arms around me I'm
feelin' on your booty
This is my song for real, no doubt Said the DJ's makin' me feel tugged out As I
walk you to the dance floor We begin to dance slow Put your arms around me I'm
feelin' on your booty
This is my song for real, no doubt Said the DJ's makin' me feel tugged out As I
walk you to the dance floor We begin to dance slow Put your arms around me I'm
feelin' on your booty
This is my song for real, no doubt Said the DJ's makin' me feel tugged out As I
walk you to the dance floor We begin to dance slow Put your arms around me
