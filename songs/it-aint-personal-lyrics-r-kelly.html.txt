Man, they go and tell me like
You never know who your true friends until you, ah umm
Both got a little bit of money
I mean, 'cause y'all both broke
Then there's no strain on the relationship, y'all both broke And if you got
money and he ain't got no paper He still needs you so you'll never know how he
really feel about you When y'all both get some paper, you'll see
We used to get money together, phone honies together Pushin chromed out
twinkies in custom coach leather You claim it's all love, but nigga it's
whatever 'Cause this is business, it ain't personal
Same dream, same team, same schemes (Mm) We even sold to the same damn fiends
(How real is dat?) Ain't no rules in this war for this green This is business,
and it ain't personal
Look, I'm a grown man dog And I ain't got time to be runnin behind y'all I know
when I first started it was crazy to y'all "He's gon' start his own label,
he'll never be able"
Well, nigga you've been wrong before And you'll be wrong again if you bet
against him We move through the hood like identical twins But it just so happen
that a nigga made it rappin
You showed your true colors, y'all niggaz stay yappin That don't stop him, a
nigga weigh platinum Stop through the hood, to say what's happenin? ('Sup

Fake hugz (Uh-huh) Fake whassup Fake love, fake fuck, fake thugs
Gotta one myself for your fake shit, I raise up Hop in my wheels and I peel,

We used to get money together, phone honies together Pushin chromed out

I wish, I wish, that success, we could all Get a piece of it (Word) But that
ain't real dog (No)
'Cause in these streets it's war, the industry much more But rich or poor, I'ma
keep it real my nigga Invest in chips and watch my money hill get bigger And do
things like, pull up to some clubs
In the skirts with Jigga, and yellin out hey What the fuck, pop that Cris' my
