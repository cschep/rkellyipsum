Girl, you know you knock me out<br>
You're a real girl with your looks now baby<br>
Girl you know you knock me out<br>
<br>
*Summer bunnies drive me crazy<br>
<i>[repeat 4 times with ad libs]</i><br>
<br>
1,2,3,4 it's time for me to jet<br>
Where ya goin' off to?<br>
The beach, that's a bet<br>
It's summertime so it's time to get a summer bunny<br>
<br>
Some of those and I won't call 'em whores<br>
'Cause in the 90s you gotta respect the ladies<br>
So step up to 'em and say, we love you sweet Sadie<br>
That's how you get your true mock on but<br>
Brothers be steppin' up poppin' that sad song<br>
<br>
Hey don't I know you from somewhere?<br>
Can we go somewhere to be alone?<br>
I pull up in the lot, pop the trunks<br>
Make their heads bob<br>
And it's sunny so it's time to get a summer bunny<br>
<br>

<br>
It's five o'clock and my voice code is 22<br>
So beep, beep, beep, it's time for me to make a move<br>
I'm on my way to a picnic, we got time<br>
But I wanna be early, fool<br>
So I can catch the new bunnies comin' in<br>
Like the old school<br>
<br>
Strollin' the block so I can check the scenery<br>
The sun plays, the day is feelin' good to me<br>
I can just semll the funky beats<br>
You know the flavor in between the sheets<br>
<br>
I told my boy Big Al, said just keep it straight<br>
Said, I know I got a novelty to validate<br>
So who's the bunny lookin' sweet like a honeycomb?<br>
He said, "No my brother, you got to get your own"<br>
<br>
<i>[*Repeat]</i><br>
<br>
This party is packed, word to the mother<br>
I love it when there's three bunnies to one brother<br>
And wine coolers is what I'm packin'<br>
And when I get my buzz on is when I start bunny-jackin'<br>
<br>
Jackin' fools for their bunnies<br>
'Cause I'm the K, the E, the double L, the Y<br>
They wanna get with me<br>
And the PAs in the house<br>
So check, check, check it out<br>
<br>
My stomach is growlin' so it's time to get mine on<br>
Some soul food, Kool Aid and you know it's on<br>
I hate to eat and run but I'm out my homie<br>
Been invited to a block party<br>
<br>
So we roll up in all our style<br>
With the brothers yellin', summer bunnies<br>
<br>

Let's break it down -<br>
You're lookin' feel good with your boots on, baby <i>[3 times]</i><br>
