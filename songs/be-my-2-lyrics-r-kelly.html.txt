I could never be your boyfriend
'Cause you know I gotta special girl
And I could never be your husband
But that don't mean you still don't rock my world
And I can take you to an island We can be there, just the two of us Girl, I
love to see you smilin' All I ask is that you keep it hush, girl
Be my number 2, girl, I love you Be my number 2, girl, I need you Be my number
2, girl, you're so fine, so fine Be my number 2 but you will never be my number
1 My number 1, my number 1, my number 1
I could take you out to dinner But there's a couple of places we won't go
'Cause number 1 is no beginner And there's a couple things that she don't know
So I can take you to a hotel We can be there just the two of us Girl, I love
you 'cause you don't tell And you know just how to keep it hush, girl
Be my number 2, girl, I love you Be my number 2, girl, I need you Be my number
2, girl, you're so fine, so fine Be my number 2 but you will never be my number
1 My number 1, my number 1, my number 1
The way you give it to me, I gotta have it, have it Ha-ha-have it, have it, ha-
ha-have it, have it 'Cause she's my beauty queen, girl, you're my habbit,
habbit Ha-ha- habbit, habbit, ha-ha- habbit, habbit
So baby, be my number 2, girl, I love you Be my number 2, girl, I need you Be
my number 2, girl, you're so fine, so fine Be my number 2 but you will never be
my number 1
Be my number 2, it may sound crazy Be my number 2, my second, baby Be my number
2, put your hands up if you Be my number 2, would you like to me my number 2?
Listen to me Though I love your sex I can't, I can't, I can't leave her, no, no
Though that *** is incredible But I can't, I can't, I can't leave her, no, no
See, we could have fun behind those doors And we could do things, girl, behind
those doors We can do anything you want behind those doors And do it all night
long behind those doors
If you be my number 2 If you be my number 2 Be my number 2 Be my number 2
Be my number 2 Be my number 2 Be my number 2 Be my number 2
And to all you hatin' *** All you hatin' *** All you hatin' *** Slap, slap,
