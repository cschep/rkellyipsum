seems like the more i climb the hill gets deeper
and the more i rise see I get deeper
its like the more I give see the more is taken
and the more I'm loved the more I'm hated
still the more I fall the more ill get up and keep on driving when the road
gets tough and i wont stop till i get whats mine but un till then see I'm
tearing down the walls and im moving the mountains i'm stirring up the sea and
be leavin in a change putting out the fire indure it to the end they will come
and i will shout victory
tearing down the walls and im moving the mountains i'm stirring up the sea and
be leavin in a change putting out the fire in dure to the end they will come
and i will shout victory

seems like the more I win the more I loose the more my minds made up the more
im confused its like the more that i search the more i get lost and just when i
get on seems like i fall off [ From: http://www.metrolyrics.com/victory-lyrics-
 but the more it rains the more i pray cause i know tomorrow will
bring a brighter day so i wont stop till i get whats mine but un till then I'm
tearing down theese walls and im moving the mountains i'm stirring up the sea
and be leavin in a change putting out the fire in dure it to the end they will
come and i will shout victory I'm tearing down the walls and im moving the
mountains i'm stirring up the sea and be leavin in a change putting out the
fire in dure it end they will come and i will shout victory
when the morning comes i will rise  there a angel for me in the sky  as long as
heavens right by my side
I'm tearing down these walls and I'm moving the mountains I'm stirring up the
sea and be leavin' in a change putting out the fire in dure it to the end they
will come and i will shout victory  ( repeat till end)
