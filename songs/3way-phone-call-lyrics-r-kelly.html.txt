on my mind But sis, I don't want to waste your time But I done told you time

Rob that ain't nothing but the devil telling you That you're washed up and
you're through But sister's here to let you know Boy you're gonna make it
through
Sister, do you really believe that I can rise again Yes, and not only that, Rob
God will forgive you for your sins Can you tell me what to do? Well first you
gotta believe the truth Sometimes it's hard to believe in Him That's okay
because He believes in you
The winds, the rain, the storm The weapons that are formed against us I will
survive The trying times, the sleepless nights Just know that faith is with us
And I believe yeah Through all of the hills and valleys roamed That we must
come to Walk side by side and follow the light And we'll make it through We'll
make it through, yeah
So, so what you're saying is believe a little more? Yes, cause faith is the key
that will opens up the door What you're saying to me, it's hard to receive
Especially when trouble follows me When we're keeping it real Robert sometimes
Trouble can follow where you lead

busy So I'm not going to mess around, nah Just telling my sister how my life is
upside down And I don't know whether I'm going left or right half the time

Similar to what I used to go through Really? Yes, and sometimes I still do
Yeah? See it doesn't matter who you are Or where you're from If you struggle,
God will use you
Amen sister, what you're saying is so true Rob are you there? Yes, I'm just
listening to the both of you It's so easy to say, but not so easy to do Yes but
if you stand the truth it will free you

high Said it wont be long In time He will provide
Will He? Yes He will You just stay in the race Just stay in the race And keep
on running And down to the end For your day is coming
The winds, the rain, the storm The weapons that are formed against us The
trying times, the sleepless nights Just know that faith is with us Through all
of the hills and valleys roamed That we must come to Walk side by side follow
the light And we'll make it through

of the hills and valleys roamed That we must come to Walk side by side follow
the light And know we'll make it through
