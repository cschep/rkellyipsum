Because of what he did<br>
But here I am to rescue you <br>
From that man of sin<br>
He took your life from you<br>
And noted you for him<br>
Promised you brighter days<br>
But now your light is dim<br>
He had no right to do<br>
The things he did to you<br>
If I had half a chance<br>
Girl, I'd be good to you<br>
Don't let don't let don't let don't let<br>
Don't let what happened in your past hurt our future<br>

You lived your life a lie<br>
Now it's time to seek the truth<br>
If it takes the rest of my days <br>

So you let your guards on down<br>

I guess its' a lesson to be learned<br>
Be careful of the bridge you burn, oh oh
