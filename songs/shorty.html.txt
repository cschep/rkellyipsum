And, Plus I'm high, but it aint over<br>
4 slim bodies scooped me in a wide body rover<br>
Panties and bras all the way from the bed to the sofa<br>
For all you R&B so called playas, I'm bout to coach ya<br>
Sit right there, and watch me freak yo girl chocha<br>
Tounge all down her throat as if a nigga was trying to choke her<br>
Its The Best Of Both Worlds, stickin ya in the "uhhhhhh!!"<br>
Put ya hands up like it's money in the air<br>
We bout to rip these charts like Zorro Blade<br>
So hot your gonna need a cold glass of lemonade<br>
To all my real live niggas, that shoot dice and play spades<br>
In a nice crib, word up,  drinking the Maid <br>
