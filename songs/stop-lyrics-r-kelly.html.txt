Yes it's true that I believe
I'm weaker than I used to be
I wear my heart out on my sleeve
Oh, and I forget the rest of me
Yes, there's times I've been afraid And there's no harm in that I pray 'Cause
I'm more frightened everyday Someone will take the hope I have, away
But you gotta give it up To get off sometimes You gotta give it up To get off
sometimes You gotta give it up To get off sometimes I know
You gotta give it up To get off sometimes You gotta give it up To get off
sometimes You gotta give it up To get off sometimes I know
All the times I've given in You fit me like a second skin And one by one I will
begin To wear you on the days I'm feeling thin
But you gotta give it up To get off sometimes You gotta give it up To get off
sometimes You gotta give it up To get off sometimes I know
Hey, I gotta give it up To get off sometimes You gotta give it up To get off
sometimes You gotta give it up To get off sometimes I know
You'd better stop, stop, stop Using me up You'd better stop 'Cause I've had
enough And I'm ready to forget the reasons That keep me here
Ooh in the rain You won't even if you never even gonna change Good god need a
little help, while You'll find what you think you gonna be child
Ya, you'd better stop, stop, stop Using me up You'd better stop 'Cause I've had
enough And I'm ready to forget the reasons Well the reasons keepin' me here
