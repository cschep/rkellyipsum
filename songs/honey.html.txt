<i>[Intro: Jay-Z]</i><br>
Uh, its the boy Jay-Z, and the boy R. Kel<br>
The best of both worlds, please believe it<br>
Brookland, Chi-Town, to all the beautiful ladies in the world<br>
Dedicated to TT my niece, everybody in the world, talk to 'em Kel<br>
That's right, Tone this is mean and vicious man, so mean and vicious<br>
Rockland, Roc-a-Fella, the best of both worlds, come on<br>
<br>
<i>[Verse 1: Jay-Z]</i><br>
Lord forgive me I'm ballin' out of control<br>
Got the spirit of a hustler pouring out of my soul<br>
Mami I love you but ain't no stopping my stroll<br>
If you wanna be down with me you gotta rooolll<br>
Like a roll and if my side of the bed gets cold<br>
You gotta know that I'm out chasin' doooough<br>
I'm ain't stunting these hoes<br>
Stunting my growth if I fuck 'em I'm fleeing them<br>
I need something to hold<br>
Then I'm home to you<br>
I might roam like a cellular phone<br>
But I never leave you alone I<br>
Solemnly swear, I was married to the block before I met you<br>
It's still a part of me there but I<br>
Solemnly swear, I try but it's in my blood<br>
Pumping yay since I was yay high<br>
I'm in love with the life<br>
So except me for the bastard that I am<br>
You're still in love with me right?<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus: R. Kelly]</i><br>
Baby I can't figure it out<br>
Said you pussy tastes like honey<br>
But I can't stop huggin' the block<br>
All night tryna get this money<br>
<br>
Stuck between these two worlds<br>
What I'm gonna do with both these girls<br>
Two main squeezes in separate cities<br>
Both found out man, shit ain't pretty<br>
Stuck between these two worlds<br>
What I'm gonna do with both these girls<br>
Hard to choose between her and these streets<br>
Cuz the game keeps calling me<br>
<br>
<i>[Verse 2: Jay-Z]</i><br>
Baby girl had me off my grind, off my clock<br>
I would often find I was off my block<br>
Couldn't keep her off my mind, my balls were shot<br>
They never thought that a pause or stop<br>
Was in my pores to push rock raw<br>
Take a lost rebound like Bo Outlaw, I'm so outlaw<br>
Got a hunger for this game, but keep that on the low<br>
Like a one against the grain<br>
Got the sun against my brain<br>
A girl in my ear<br>
I like her for her<br>
I'm a dig into this shit, I like it like I like her<br>
Sometimes I can't figure it out<br>
I'm in love with the life but she's sticking it out<br>
She know wanna hug kisses keep a nigga in the house<br>
Lock down while his niggas is out (out)<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus X2]</i>
