A lot of these cats out here be fakin' 'em
When it come to makin' love
But you and me baby, this is real
And that's why it's number one
Sex that we're having here girl, ooh This is, this is number one Sex that we're
having here, girl, ooh (You better ask somebody)
Can't nobody do it like us Can't nobody mix, chop, and screw it like us All
over the living room, hittin' it like us In the middle of the night wake up the
building like us
And it's okay if you wanna brag, the sex so good Go and pat yourself on the
back, and 'em haters They gon' hate, but we just gon' keep blowing up 'Cause
girl, they gon' hate anyway
You are now rocking with the best I'll make you forget about the rest Having
sex with you is like making hits Girl, we got egos, they can't tell us That we
ain't the shit and no
I'm in your mix like a number one record And the beat goes on and on And it
don't stop you keep going, from the night on through the day And I love it when
you take me down and make me say
Number one Sex that we're having here, girl, ooh This is, this is number one
Sex that we're having here girl, ooh, Keri
You know you stay at the top spot When you're breaking me down just like a chop
shop, hey Cutting like some blades on a caddy That's how you're working me,
daddy Every time you put that on my womb
You are now rocking with the best I'll make you forget about your ex This one
here's a race where you don't wanna come first I know what I'm doing, ain't no
need to rehearse, yeah A lot of dudes just be going nowhere fast But you be
steady cruising like you want it to last
That's how you made me a chocoholic And right now my body's callin' I gotta
know how, you got the know how Baby, you the champ of all that goes down
If your dick was a gun, it was stone cold With my R&B thug when I bang, bang
You know Kells and Keri hook up like that You make it number one
Number one Sex that we're having here girl, ooh This is, this is number one Sex
that we're having here, girl, ooh
Hands down you the best, ain't no competition You and me, in this bed, just
what I was wishin' Them other girls was cool, but it's somethin' they was
missin' And I don't call them back ever since we hit it in the kitchen
That night at my home, trench coat, nothin' on Your sex got me gone, went
straight to my dome And I love it, girl, I love it, ooh, I love it, girl, I
love it
Girl, there's somethin' about you that thrills me That's why after we lay, you
get to know the real me, yeah And it don't stop, you keep going from the night
on through the day And I love it when you take me down and make me say
Number one Sex that we're having here, girl, ooh This is this is number one Sex
that we're having here, girl, ooh
Girl, I vow that I would do anything to pleasure you All I wanna do is make
this last I'll kiss you up, I'll kiss you down, be real quiet, or making sounds
Take it slow, or take it fast
And woo and wee and you and me havin' fun And when it's over in the morning,
I'll say gracias, baby Before you go I'll scream, "Damelo!" Number one This is,
this is number one
