I'm standing here looking in the mirror<br>
Saying "damn" to myself<br>
I should have known the day would come<br>
That she would find somebody else<br>
And all the things I took her through <br>
Shit, I shouldn't have lasted this long<br>
Now I'm at this telephone booth calling Tyrone<br>
<br>
<i>[1]</i> - Cuz when a woman's fed up<br>
(No matter how you beg, no)<br>
It ain't nothing you can do about it<br>
(Nothing you can do about it)<br>
It's like running out of love<br>
(No matter what you say, no)<br>
And then it's too late to talk about it<br>
(Too late to talk about it)<br>
<br>
Now let's talk about how it all goes down<br>
I used to make love to you daily<br>
When the night fell the same<br>
And anytime that you were hurt<br>
I could feel your pain<br>
And if I had a dollar<br>
It was yours, yeah<br>
And whenever we would go out<br>
I would front the bill <br>
But now the up is down<br>
And the silence is sound<br>
I hurt you too too many times<br>
Now I can't come around<br>
<br>
<i>[1]</i> - Cuz when a woman's fed up<br>
(No matter how you beg, no)<br>
It ain't nothing you can do about it<br>
(Nothing you can do about it)<br>
It's like running out of love<br>
(No matter what you say, no)<br>
And then it's too late to talk about it<br>
(Too late to talk about it)<br>
<br>
La da da da da la la da da<br>
La da da da da la la da da<br>
If you don't want to find out the hard way<br>
Then listen to this song while the record plays<br>
<br>
<i>[1]</i> - Cuz when a woman's fed up<br>
(No matter how you beg, no)<br>
It ain't nothing you can do about it<br>
(Nothing you can do about it)<br>
It's like running out of love<br>
(No matter what you say, no)<br>
And then it's too late to talk about it<br>
(Too late to talk about it)<br>
<br>
You can cry a river <br>
'Till an ocean starts to form, yeah<br>
But she will always remember <br>
Cuz she's a woman scorned<br>
And if you ever get her back<br>
It will never be the same<br>
She's cuttin' the corners of her eyes<br>
Every time she see your face<br>
Now your trust is out the door<br>
She don't want you no more<br>
You used to tell your boys, not me<br>
And she would always be there for you<br>
If you had took the time to see <br>
What that woman meant to you<br>
Is what the mirror said to me, whoa<br>
She was raised in Illinois <br>
Right outside of Chicago<br>
Some of the best cookin' you ever had<br>
Yes, it was and I miss her<br>
Hey woman, if you're listening<br>
I said I miss you baby
