Whatchu know about the Mobster Elites Crucial Conflict and dem Do or Die flows?
Whatchu know about Kellz & Twist Two multi-platinum artists steppin' out the
suicide doors?
I ain't claimin' the crown or the throne But I know I'm Chi-town to the bone
Come and have a round of Patron And get down to the song while I tell you 'Bout
the ground, I be on Chicago
Tell a girl about K-town and the projects Downtown and all these places Caught
her starin' at the ice in my ear She almost fainted when she saw these glaciers

Feel the words when I spit 'em in the mic First I gotta get up with the mob in
the light Rollin' 40 deep to the club and I'm like Gotta see who I'm 'bout to
fuck tonight
The party so live and I'm 'bout to set it off for the 0 5 It's all good but I
got the 4 5 And I found me get down ass hoe for ride And she got a fat ol' ass
that'll brighten up the room Come, let a West Side Nigga slide this dick off in
yo womb
Put the dial on her booty make her lively Most likely, she think I'ma make her
wifey Got her hooked like Nike, she wanna bite me When I come up in the room in
a White-Tee
Presidential Suite, wit some drank And some kush about to get 'em on After dis
one night, I'ma be the one you call When you wanna get a hit until the early
mon, pimp on
Till the sun comes up, yo, can I hit it till the mornin I'll be sexin' you up
until the sun goes down We ride, get high, hit clubs, we ball, we bad

the club, 708 reppin' the Chi I'm at the bar talkin' to this chic sippin' on
that magic potion Tryna get her to let me dive off in that ass like it's an
ocean
Rub her down with some Heated lotion and now, got honey soakin' She's ready for

Wanna turn that ass over and ride Good-bye to them other guys

Yo Kellz, take another sip, den another trip buy another fifth (Now, another

(Still a lot of platinum on me)
Sit back, relax and watch her ride on me Get up in the morning do the same to

Prada
Hit it from the back and make her girlfriend holla Pimperish but he walk like a

toes curl up when I know she's cummin' They supposed to be cummin' I can give
you what you want like some dick for days
Belo, be a nimfo girl and I can kiss you Where you wanna, sex you 3-4 ways Like

until the sun goes down We ride, get high, hit clubs, we ball, we bad
Till the sun comes up, yo, can I hit it till the mornin I'll be sexin' you up
