She didnt have a house, a house up in the hills
I never heard her ask for some car with the chromed out wheels
But all she wanted was some love and affection
But all I did all the time was neglect
The fact that she was lonely, I used to be her homey I used to talk about how I
was gonna get us out of the hood But as long as were together as a family,
then its all good
Because any man can make a baby But it takes a real man to be a father Talking
bout a family, the kid, you and me Its not a fantasy, but its reality You
see love is wrong and love is right But if love is strong then love is tight
Talking bout a chemistry like a bride-to-be Its not a fantasy, but its
reality
Be careful were the words the last time we had our talk And your truth sound
absurd so my pride just let you walk When all the time knowin' that I didnt
mean To holler out and call you, 'Bitch' and tell you leave I admit it, I was
wrong, but now its over, come on home I cant take it, here is where you
belong
Even out the window looking for the mailman I hope hes got a letter says, "Im
missing you", in the mail And then I saw you with another Made it hard for me
to breathe But when I played the game for gives I shouldve played the game for
keeps
Because any man can make a baby But it takes a real man to be a father Talking
bout a family, the kid, you and me Its not a fantasy, but its reality You
see love is wrong and love is right But if love is strong then love is tight
Talking bout a chemistry like a bride-to-be Its not a fantasy, but its
reality
Now I wore the shoes that you talked about in the song But its been a change
Ive got a new pair on, yes Now every night and day I still await At the lonely
spot in the hills and think about How you set the record straight Any man can
Any man can make a baby But it takes a real man to be a father Talking bout a
family, the kid, you and me Its not a fantasy, but its reality You see love
is wrong and love is right But if love is strong then love is tight Talking
bout a chemistry like a bride-to-be Its not a fantasy, but its reality
Any man can make a baby But it takes a real man to be a father Talking bout a
family, the kid, you and me Its not a fantasy, but its reality You see love
is wrong and love is right But if love is strong then love is tight Talking
bout a chemistry like a bride-to-be Its not a fantasy, but its reality
Any man can make a baby But it takes a real man to be a father Talking bout a
family, the kid, you and me Its not a fantasy, but its reality You see love
is wrong and love is right
