Baby, oh baby<br>
I know we had an argument and all<br>
Ooh babe<br>
And I must have said some pretty foul shit but<br>
Mmm, mmm<br>
I just want you to know that I ain't mean none of that<br>
Baby, baby<br>
None of it<br>
<br>
Now I was supposed to be a man about it<br>
Shoulda never left your side<br>
No way, no how<br>
Put too many years in this relationship<br>
And it's not that serious for us to split<br>
Now I admit sometimes I make mistakes<br>
But still I appreciate the love we make<br>
Stop at the door and put your bags back down<br>
Now baby please can we work this out<br>
<br>
Now I might say you can walk<br>
(But I don't mean it)<br>
And I might name call<br>
(I don't mean it)<br>
I may pull some silly stunts<br>
(Uhm mmm)<br>
But that's just a front, I don't mean it<br>
(Now wait a minute hear me out)<br>
Now I may holler at you<br>
(I don't mean it)<br>
And I may tell you we're through<br>
(But I don't mean it, no, no)<br>
May give you looks that can kill<br>
(Can kill)<br>
But it's not for real<br>
(Not for real)<br>
I don't mean it<br>
(I don't mean it hey)<br>
<br>
Now I was supposed to be more understanding<br>
Instead of tryin to be so damn demandin<br>
Baby I'm willing to drop my ego<br>
And do the things I should have done and more<br>
See I know that I can be a better man<br>
Girl all you gotta do is take my hand<br>
Promise me this time<br>
I'm goin all the way<br>
And show you all the reasons why you stayed<br>
<br>
Now I might say you can walk<br>
(But I don't mean it, no, no)<br>
And I might name call<br>
(Girl I don't mean it)<br>
I may pull some silly stunts<br>
(Ooh yeah)<br>
But that's just a front, I don't mean it<br>
(Listen baby)<br>
Now I may holler at you<br>
(But I don't mean it)<br>
And I may tell you we're through<br>
(Girl you should know, I don't mean it)<br>
May give you looks that can kill<br>
(Um mmm)<br>
But it's not for real<br>
I don't mean it<br>
(Come here girl)<br>
<br>
See I never meant<br>
To break you down<br>
And make you cry, make you cry<br>
Oh please baby please<br>
Turn back around<br>
Don't you say goodbye, say goodbye<br>
Sometimes I know that<br>
I can take it<br>
Just a little bit too far<br>
But yo my heart is good<br>
Heart is good<br>
So baby you don't have to worry<br>
You're gonna see a change<br>
Girl you know I love ya<br>
Even though I may say<br>
<br>
Now I might say you can walk<br>
(I don't mean it)<br>
And I might name call<br>
(But I don't mean it)<br>
I may pull some silly stunts<br>
(Hey)<br>
But that's just a front<br>
(Hey, hey)<br>
I don't mean it<br>
(I don't mean it, I don't mean it)<br>
Now I may holler at you<br>
(When I'm hollerin' at you)<br>
And I may tell you we're through<br>
(I never mean it when I say we're through)<br>
May give you looks that can kill<br>
(Kill)<br>
But it's not for real<br>
(Real)<br>
I don't mean it<br>
(I don't mean it)<br>
<br>
Now I might say you can walk<br>
(I don't mean it)<br>
And I might name call<br>

But it's not for real<br>
(Real)<br>
I don't mean it<br>
(I don't mean it)<br>
<br>
Now I might say you can walk<br>
(I may say that you can walk but I don't)<br>
And I might name call<br>
(Girl I promise I don't mean it)<br>
I may pull some silly stunts<br>
(Silly stunts)<br>
But that's just a front<br>
(Just a front)<br>
I don't mean it<br>
(Thinkin' I'm cool but I'm a fool)<br>
Now I may holler at you<br>
(When I'm hollerin' at you)<br>
And I may tell you we're through<br>
(I never mean it when I say we're through)<br>
May give you looks that can kill<br>

Now I may holler at you<br>
And I may tell you we're through<br>
May give you looks that can kill<br>
But it's not for real<br>
