<i>[1]</i> - All that money I spend<br>
All those places I been<br>
I can't forget you babe<br>
Here's life without you<br>
Working hard for this loot<br>
Girl I wanna spend it with you <br>
I want you with me babe<br>
Here's life without you<br>
<br>
Baby, through all the ups and down<br>
You were a lady<br>
I wanna show you how I love you<br>
Baby, deserve the very best<br>
And I, I'll give it to you, only you<br>
How can I show you that <br>
Only you satisfy everything that you do<br>
Baby girl, anything that you want<br>
I'll give to you <br>
Just promise me forever, boo<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
Baby I can't imagine life without you<br>
With me, I never want to be without you<br>
Baby, I want you to believe it's true <br>
All that I do, I do for you<br>
How can I show you that<br>
Only you could satisfy, everything that you do<br>
Anything that you want I'll give to you <br>
Just promise me forever, boo<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
Don't know why you stayed by my side for so long<br>
So I dedicate baby, in every way <br>
All my heart and soul<br>
It all belongs to you<br>
<br>
