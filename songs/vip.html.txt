Rock on, come on, come on<br>
Come on, come on, come on<br>
Chillin' at the club<br>
Showing niggas how we ball<br>
Ever since the drought<br>
It's been nothing but the trump<br>
<br>
Can you really blame me for getting these G's<br>
Something I don't understand<br>
Why you fools after me, VIP<br>
Got the haters after me<br>
Cuz I push these V's<br>
They wanna be like me<br>
If you agree<br>
Then raise the roof with me<br>
In the party place to be<br>
Living VIP<br>
<br>
Since when did money, oh<br>
Become such a problem<br>
I just wanna live a life<br>
That only involve the numbers, yeah<br>
<br>
Can you really blame me for getting these G's<br>
See what I can't understand<br>
Why you fools don't rock with me, VIP<br>
I got the haters after me <br>
Because I push these V's<br>
They wanna be like me<br>
If you agree (If you agree)<br>
Then raise the roof with me (Raise the roof with me)<br>
In the party place to be (In the party place to be)<br>
Living VIP <br>
<br>

Ha ha, nothing but the<br>
Stretch Bentleys with the top thats drop, that's right<br>
Kelly CD's with the sound that knocks<br>
Di di di di di di di<br>
When the party rocks<br>
Fingers to the wrist filled with nothin but rocks<br>
I know you haters wanna come to Rockland's party<br>
But you can't get in unless you VIP<br>
<br>
Can you really blame me for getting these G's<br>
See what I can't understand<br>
Why you fools are after me, livin' V<br>
So if you're ballin' and you know, raise your hands<br>
And if you sexy and you know it, stomp your feet<br>
And if your man ain't spendin' money on you<br>
Then ladies, you can come and get with me<br>
A little V<br>
<br>

Yo, uh huh, wish I could call up all the haters<br>
I mean, I wish I could make a phone call <br>
To all the haters around the world<br>
You know what I'm saying?<br>
This is what I'd say<br>
What's goin' on in the world today, huh?<br>
Seems like every nigga got beef cuz they ain't got steak <br>
When I ain't had no money see, everything was cool<br>
But now that I got a little money and y'all wanna act a fool<br>
And none of 'em VIP<br>
<br>
VIP, I got the haters after me<br>
Because I push these V's (What?)<br>
They wanna be like me (Raise the roof, y'all)<br>
If you agree (Now let's lock)<br>
And raise the roof with me<br>
(Over this here's, just bring it on)<br>
In the party place (Uh, Rockland)<br>
To be living VIP, VIP<br>
<br>
I got the haters after me<br>
Because I push these V's<br>
They wanna be like me<br>
(Wanna be a.....)
