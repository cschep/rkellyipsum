Changing Faces
How we do
Yo All of my rhymes fall all of my days I trade All of my dimes and all of my
bad ways I fade Killing late nights cruisin' all you see is the break lights
And hair blowing you know where we going Or at the club in the rear frontin',
poppin', droppin' The amounts of cats but we ain't trying to hear nothing
Probably was wilder than wobbly are you the wiggy to give me Hold me down and
make me slow down to be twissy
Keep the ice out the club life change face Get on love wife while he on the
license plates Wait make me think about you even when your not around Use the
bathroom put the toilet seat back down Got me some sprinkles the hair with the
wrinkles If preferred his and her furs to the ankles Keep your friends buggin'
lovin' all my ways Jigga keep me Jiggly all of my days
In the middle of the night Got me thinkin' about cha babe Got me dreamin' about
cha baby
All that I have All that I have Baby it's yours Baby it's yours forever and
ever baby All I want is to be with you all of my days All I want, all I need
All I want is to be with you all of my days All I want baby
Anything that turn you on I'll be givin' it to you, babe You don't have to
worry, baby
All that I have All that I have Baby it's yours Baby it's yours forever and
ever baby All I want is to be with you all of my days All I want, all I need
All I want is to be with you all of my days All I want baby
Yeah ha ha, check it All I want, all I need You in my life, loving me All I
want, all I need You in my life Uh huh Loving me
Now we going house shoppin' Everybody want to know the prices of spouse
droppin' Keep it on the low R Kelly style it's quite shockin' A year ago all I
did was spend nights hoppin' In the club in search of pretty faces and night
stalkers Who would have thought I'd walk down the aisle Rice droppin' got you a
nice rock and Now it's on and poppin' droppin' holiday platinum bracelets
Jigga, R Kelly, Changing Faces
All I want is to be with you all of my days All I want, all I need All I want
is to be with you all of my days All I want baby
All I want is to be with you all of my days All I want, all I need All I want
is to be with you all of my days All I want baby
