Wars, walls, tumble and falls
Time, change, clouds and rain
Through it all, I will stand
Come what may, um hmm
Throw in the towel, not today 'cause where there's a will There's a way, whoa
1 - I'm gonna hold Hold on, hold on, hold on I'm gonna hold Hold on, hold on,
hold on Until the finish I'll be strong
Oceans, strong winds, hills and mountains Sacrifice, paying the price, yeah
Struggle all your life Through it all, I will stand Come what may, yes I will
Throw in the towel, no not today 'cause where there's a will There's a way,
whoa
 Repeat 1
I see tomorrow will surely come And I'm gonna be the first to see the sun Throw
in the towel, not today 'cause I know that where there's a will There's a way,
whoa
Repeat 1
Repeat 1 while: On the highway, and the bi-way If I just hold on I'mma make it
there someday Through the storm and through the rain You can knock me down But
I'm gonna stand again Yes I will Running on this track, hey If I keep my pace,
hey I can see the finish line I'm gonna win this race Hey, hold on, hold on
