Down low double life
1, 2 equals us, she, she and me, I fell in loves
How could something so right go so wrong?
Just coming in on flight 412 but she was listening on the phone
I thought I had it all together but I was wrong obviously 'Coz what was once
done in the dark came to light eventually
Living down low, down low Living that double life Living down low, down low
Living that double life, it ain't right
I don't believe the shit I did, the night we were at your mom's I got a page
from out of town, lied and said, "It was my job" Grabbed my hat, coat, gloves
and scarf, I told you that I would return But by the look upon your face you
had already discerned So you pulled me to the side and you begged for me to
stay But I was caught up in a life that forced me to walk away
Living down low, down low Living that double life Living down low, down low
Living that double life, it ain't right
Okay you, you're saying you came in and And these two women they, they poured
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, it wasn't nothing like that All I know is uh, I was
asleep, they came in Woke me up pourin' hot grits and all kinds of shit on me
man Okay, beatin' me and shit, hittin' me with all sorts of type shit Damn
With a cigar in my mouth over Vegas city lights On a path way up the hill to be
with my other wife A rich nigga living strife going on like nothing's wrong But
that damn caller ID is the reason for this song So one called up the other
while I was out playing some golf Talking about my doggish ways and how I need
to be dropped off
Living down low, down low Living that double life Living down low, down low
Living that double life, it ain't right
Now go ahead, shoot me now because I'm guilty as sin Playin' Russian roulette
with hearts not to mention the kids Now every day I live, I regret all that I
did Out smoking with friends as I reminisced
Living down low, down low Living that double life Living down low, down low
Living that double life, it ain't right
I can't take it no more, I've got to confess See now, I don't know why I
thought that I could keep creeping 'Coz you see what goes around comes back on
around And back on around and back on around again, yes it does, oh
In a state of shock that's what it left me Take it from a man who knows that
three ain't company No, no, no that's what I kept telling myself Now I done
lost the houses, the kids and the dogs Now I'm sleeping in my momma's house and
even she says "Your sorry ass don't deserve no help" Must be because of what my
old man did to her
