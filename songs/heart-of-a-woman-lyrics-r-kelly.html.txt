This song is dedicated to all of the ladies from all of the men
Simply because yall go through so much
And we want yall to know that we recognize that
There are so many answers to the question what yall do for us
And so many reasons for the word why we love on yall For instance how you just
take us and lift us up Give us chance after chance and we still find a way to
Fuck things up And sometimes yall go and blame yourself for the things we do
Cause you love us so much our lies become the truth Yall try so, so hard to
make things work Finding a way to smile just to keep from showing your hurting
Its your mind versus your heart versus your soul versus your body Versus our
bullshit and our ego and our pride Thats why I love the word woman (oh I love,
I love) Yall are so tough yall put up with so much Thats why I love the word
woman (oh I love, I love) And yall so full of trust and besides yall know us
Thats why I love the word woman Time and time again yall let us back in And I
love yall so much I gotta spell it out W-O-M-A-N thats what its all about, yeah

Sometimes I think that were the reason why yall be stressing out and smoking
Cigarettes, mmm yes I do And sometimes I think were the reasons yall be
snapping off on your kids and Having fits, somebody feel me Ladies when its
that time of the month and yall really dont feel like being Bothered And
sometimes we take yall hearts for granted I know yall gotta ask yall Selves
sometimes why do I even put up with it
Its your mind versus your heart versus your soul versus your body Versus our
bullshit and our ego and our pride Thats why I love the word woman (oh I love,
I love) Yall are so tough yall put up with so much Thats why I love the word
woman (oh I love, I love) And yall so full of trust and besides yall know us
Thats why I love the word woman Time and time again yall let us back in And I
love yall so much I gotta spell it out W-O-M-A-N thats what its all about, yeah

Fellas just swallow your pride for a minute and grab your lady by the hand and
Sing Baby Im sorry for the drama that I caused you Yall are the backbone of
every family this much is true I recognize being a woman the things yall go
through And I appreciate every single one of you Baby I promise from this day I
will show respect I promise to love yall yeah With all of my might yeah Ill
even burn a candlelight Because we are here cause yall paid a price And thats
why I love
Its your mind versus your heart versus your soul versus your body Versus our
bullshit and our ego and our pride Thats why I love the word woman (oh I love,
I love) Yall are so tough yall put up with so much Thats why I love the word
woman (oh I love, I love) And yall so full of trust and besides yall know us
Thats why I love the word woman Time and time again yall let us back in And I
love yall so much I gotta spell it out W-O-M-A-N thats what its all about, yeah
