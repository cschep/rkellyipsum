Baby, it's nobody like you, you're a good friend, you know
You've been there for me from the beginning
And this is why I love you, I mean I place no one above you
You know what I'm saying
Anything you want you just come to daddy, listen
When I discovered you, I discovered a piece within A joy like no other, you are
my closest friend If you were a number you'd be a perfect 10 Right out of the
blue skies you were Heaven sent
The way we made love over and over again If I had to describe it, wouldn't know
where to begin I am so proud to be your next of kin You prayed over me when I
had no reason to live
Candy, caramel coated taffies, chocolate covered strawberries Love so sweet,
you're my chocolate factory Gum drops mixed with chocolate, milk bars, there's
so much variety Love so sweet, you're my chocolate factory
Wait a minute, baby Now, if I could write a book on how you make me feel The
title would read, a strong black man and that's for real I've been going round
and round just like a ferris wheel Been in and out of relationships but you're
that deal
There ain't nobody else on God's great earth for me Heaven stirred us up
together and made the perfect chemistry Wouldn't change you for the world as
long as I exist You're always in the kitchen cooking up my favorite dish
Candy, caramel coated taffies, chocolate covered strawberries Love so sweet,
you're my chocolate factory Gum drops mixed with chocolate, milk bars, there's
so much variety Love so sweet, you're my chocolate factory
You're that puzzle piece that completes me Girl, you set my soul free Girl,
you're everything Girl you're everything that I could need
Youre my escape when I wanna be free When I wanna be free, yeah You're full of
dainty treats Like peppermint, sweet tarts, big blues, red hots, baby you are
Candy, caramel coated taffies, chocolate covered strawberries Love so sweet,
you're my chocolate factory Gum drops mixed with chocolate, milk bars, there's
so much variety Love so sweet, you're my chocolate factory
Candy, caramel coated taffies, chocolate covered strawberries Love so sweet,
you're my chocolate factory Gum drops mixed with chocolate, milk bars, there's
so much variety Love so sweet, you're my chocolate factory
Candy, caramel coated taffies, chocolate covered strawberries Love so sweet,
you're my chocolate factory Gum drops mixed with chocolate, milk bars, there's
so much variety Love so sweet, you're my chocolate factory
Candy, caramel coated taffies, chocolate covered strawberries Love so sweet,
you're my chocolate factory Gum drops mixed with chocolate, milk bars, there's
so much variety Love so sweet, you're my chocolate factory
