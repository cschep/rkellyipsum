I've been kickin' it with your girlfriend, what am I gonna do?
'Cause, God knows that I really didn't mean to hurt you
I know it's bogus, but I felt that you should know the truth
I fell in love with her the moment we were introduced
And I just feel that it's time for this little secret to end Baby, I'm kickin'
it with your girlfriend
Oh, oh, oh
Go on and slap me again, 'cause I can understand how you feel When a man takes
you for granted and he don't keep it real I should've been more man and told
you a long time ago Instead of stunnin', I should have broke it down and let
you know
Girl, my fault for that, don't know what's on my mind And I blame myself for
wastin' your time Believe, I really tried to keep that girl away from me But
her body language kept on temptin' and teasin' me
And plus, she knew what she was doing and did it anyway I knew what she was
doing, too, and that made it okay Truth is that we don't even regret it Up out
the closet, I will be the first to say it
I've been kickin' it with your girlfriend, what am I gonna do? 'Cause, God
knows that I really didn't mean to hurt you I know it's bogus, but I felt that
you should know the truth
I fell in love with her the moment we were introduced And I just feel that it's
time for this little secret to end Baby, I'm kickin' it with your girlfriend
Oh, oh, oh
Now, I apologize for me and her and everything that went down These are the
reasons why some girls don't bring they friends around I just didn't know how
to tell I was feelin' her And how we would get away sometimes and make love
I never wanted to mislead you At first I just wanted to please you I know it's
hard for you to be able to trust again 'Cause I came between you and your best
friend
I did not ask for this It just happened outta no where since the day we kissed
And, the truth is that we don't even regret it Up out the closet, I will be the
first to say it
I've been kickin' it with your girlfriend, what am I gonna do? 'Cause, God
knows that I really didn't mean to hurt you I know it's bogus, but I felt that
you should know the truth
I fell in love with her the moment we were introduced And I just feel that it's
time for this little secret to end Baby, I'm kickin' it with your girlfriend
Oh, I'm sorry again, never meant to hurt you I'm sorry again but girl, I love
her I'm sorry again, I never meant to make you cry, no Now I'm right out the
closet
I've been kickin' it with your girlfriend, what am I gonna do? 'Cause, God
knows that I really didn't mean to hurt you I know it's bogus, but I felt that
you should know the truth
I fell in love with her the moment we were introduced And I just feel that it's
time for this little secret to end Baby, I'm kickin' it with your girlfriend
I've been kickin' it with your girlfriend, what am I gonna do? 'Cause, God
knows that I really didn't mean to hurt you I know it's bogus, but I felt that
you should know the truth I fell in love with her the moment we were introduced
