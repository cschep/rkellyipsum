My time, my patience, my love<br>
My blood, my sweat, my tears<br>
My burdens, my drama, my pain<br>
My car, my money, my home<br>
My ups, my downs, my fears<br>
And my hours, my work, my strength<br>
My fault, my this, my that<br>
Nigga please<br>
<br>
If you don't stop<br>
(This is a warning)<br>
Someone's gonna lay in your bed<br>
(This is a warning)<br>
And someone's gonna eat your food<br>
(This is a warning)<br>
And someone's gonna wear your clothes<br>
(This is a warning)<br>
And someone's gonna fit your shoes<br>
(This is a warning)<br>
And someone's gonna get your keys<br>
(This is a warning)<br>
And someone's gonna open your doors<br>
(This is a warning)<br>
Someone's gonna get your check<br>
(This is a warning)<br>
This is a woman's threat<br>
Baby, this is a woman's threat<br>
<br>
My shakin', my sleep, my stress<br>
My days, my night, my rest<br>
My do's, my don'ts, my dares<br>
And my church, my pastor, my prayers<br>
My all, my faith, my powers<br>
And my kitchen, my sink, my towels<br>
My joy, my sad, my hate<br>
And my sister, my cousin, my friends<br>
My lights, my gas, my bills<br>
My role, my way, my will<br>
My hollerin', my fussin', my fights<br>
Nigga please<br>
<br>
If you don't stop<br>
(This is a warning)<br>
Someone's gonna lay in your bed<br>
(This is a warning)<br>
And someone's gonna eat your food<br>

And someone's gonna open your doors<br>
(This is a warning)<br>
Someone's gonna get your check<br>
(This is a warning)<br>
This is a woman's threat<br>
Baby<br>
<br>
My future, my hopes, my dreams<br>
My panties, my socks, my things<br>
My flowers, my dress, my ring<br>
My man, my lover, my king<br>
My live, my chance, my fault<br>
And my guts, my courage, my wounds<br>
My fence, my neighbors, my yard<br>
My chains, my lock, my guards<br>
My win, my lose, my gain<br>
And my credit, my card, my name<br>
Myself, my freedom, my roof<br>
Nigga please<br>
<br>
If you don't stop<br>
(This is a warning)<br>
Someone's gonna lay in your bed<br>

Baby, this is a woman's threat<br>
<br>
Listen<br>
(Whoa, whoa...)<br>
Have you ever heard the story<br>
About the three little bears<br>
See they papa was gone<br>
For a long, long, long, long time<br>
When he returned<br>
To his sweet little home<br>
He had come to find<br>
That all of his porridge was gone<br>
<br>
If you don't stop<br>

And someone's gonna open your doors<br>
(This is a warning)<br>
Someone's gonna get your check<br>
(This is a warning)<br>
This is a woman's threat
