I'ma bout to go to Loveland do you wanna go with me
I'ma bout to go to Loveland do you wanna go with me
I'ma bout to go to Loveland do you wanna go with me
I'ma bout to go to Loveland do you wanna go with me
Ooh it's unbelievable How your body feels next to mine Ooh it's uncontrollable

Fulfilling my greatest fantasy Stroking it round and round I don't know what
else to do but love you suga So come on let's cuddle up and make sweet love You

Step in my room Take your clothes off Hit the shower Let you hair down Get in
my bed Making sounds Me on top of you rolling around Repeat
Ooh we don't know What tomorrow will bring So we gonna make this last forever
I'ma bout to taste your love till you can't take it anymore sweetheart Imagine
that said I guarantee to make your body come to me Hey baby I'm gon set your
soul free Girl I'm bout to take you into Loveland
Step in my room Take your clothes off Hit the shower Let you hair down Get in
my bed Making sounds Me on top of you rolling around Repeat
It takes love for the world to go round and round Even though it has its ups
and down Joy is the key to my soul Anyone unlock me Ooh Lord have mercy
Step in my room Take your clothes off Hit the shower Let you hair down Get in
my bed Making sounds Me on top of you rolling around Repeat
