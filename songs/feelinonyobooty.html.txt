<i>[1]</i> - This is my song for real, no doubt<br>
Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out<br>
As I walk you to the dance floor<br>
We begin to dance slow<br>
Put your arms around me<br>
I'm feelin' on your booty<br>
<br>
Hey pretty mama how you doing?<br>
Said I'm just in town for the weekend<br>
Looking for a little trouble to get into<br>
Baby tell me what you're drinking<br>
And I got you, ooh<br>
<br>
Playas wanna play<br>
Ballers wanna ball<br>
Rollers wanna roll<br>
But I'm taking off after I dance, oh yeah<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1 (2x)]</i><br>
<br>
Now you're body's got me feelin' like spending<br>
With a backroom I could come to live in<br>
And your hair weave looking kind of pretty<br>
The way you back it up on me baby<br>
Lord have mercy<br>
<br>
Playas wanna play<br>
Ballers wanna ball<br>
Rollers wanna roll<br>
But I'm taking off after I dance, yeah<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1 (2x)]</i><br>
<br>
If it's your birthday<br>
Then put your hands up<br>
You wanna get drunk<br>
Then put your hands up<br>
And if you got some cash<br>
Then put your hands up<br>
Have your own job<br>
Put your hands up<br>
<br>
Playas wanna play<br>
Ballers wanna ball<br>
Rollers wanna roll<br>
Feel so good, say it again<br>
Playas wanna play<br>
Ballers wanna ball<br>
Rollers wanna roll<br>
But I'm taking off after I dance, oh yeah<br>
<br>
