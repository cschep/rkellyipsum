You made the sun,<br>
You made the moon,<br>
Gave seasons change,<br>
Woah<br>
You made the clouds,<br>
You put the rainbow after rain<br>
Woah<br>
Created time,<br>
Now this ones mine,<br>
Gave pictures frames,<br>
Woah<br>
Created man gave him woman,<br>
Why did you do that for me?<br>
<br>
These are the questions asked  before i lay me down and go to sleep, (ooh sometimes i wonder)<br>
Sometimes i wonder why you decided to keep you hands on me.<br>
Of all the miracles, signs and wonders,<br>
There's still one mystery,<br>
How did you manage to love me?<br>
<br>
You breathed the life right into me,<br>
Then made my heart beat,<br>
Woah<br>
Created the mountains,<br>
And all of the deep seas,<br>
Flowers in the trees,<br>
Woah<br>
You made tommorrow come again,<br>
You calmed the strong winds,<br>
Woah<br>
And after all I've done,<br>
Gave me a son,<br>
Tell me why would you do that for me?<br>
<br>
These are the questions asked  before i lay me down and go to sleep,<br>
(Right in the middle of my prayers)<br>
Sometimes i wonder why you decided to keep you hands on me.<br>
Of all the miracles, signs and wonders,<br>
There's still one mystery,<br>
How did you manage to love me? (how did you manage that?)<br>
How did you manage to love me?<br>
<br>
Said I've got to know how (how did you manage to love?)<br>
After all that i have done, oh Lord<br>
How? (how did you manage to love?)<br>
How could i have been so bad, oh Lord<br>
How? (how did you manage to forgive me?)<br>
Even when i didnt believe in me you believed in me Lord.<br>
How? (how did you manage to forgive me?)<br>
Jesus you sacrificed your dear life for me.<br>
(How did you manage to forgive me?)<br>
Ooooh Lord tell me (why did the pain uprise for me)
