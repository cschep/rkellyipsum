Did you get my card?
Did you read my love letter?
Did it touch your heart
When you read my love letter?
Sunny days, smiling face, spirit filled heaven praise Memories in my mind
reminiscing of good times Miracles so amazed, soldiers far away It makes me ask
the question, baby
Did you get my card? Did you read my love letter? Did it touch your heart When
you read my love letter? When you read my love letter
Weekends and birthdays, celebrations, holidays Love making history, a toast to
our victory Sweet dreams butterflies, holding hands side by side Best friends,
families, reminds me
Did you get my card? Did you read my love letter? Did it touch your heart When
you read my love letter?
Cocktails, happy hours, wedding bells, baby showers Vacations, sail boats with
the ones you love the most Long time, no see, back together you and me Write me
back when you receive this year
Did you get my card? Did you read my love letter? Did it touch your heart When
you read my love letter?
I hope these, hope these words find you in the perfect mood I wrote this letter
according to my love for you So I hope this paper will travel safely to where
you are Because the melody is custom made for your heart
Though near or far I will find a way to send my love Only pray that it don't
come back, return to sender If you are reading this I hope that things are well
And you can text me back, you can write me back Just check your mail
Did you get my card? Did you read my love letter? Did it touch your heart When
you read my love letter?
Did you get my card? Did you read my love letter? Did it touch your heart When
you read my love letter?
All the ladies sing for me Ladies sing for me
