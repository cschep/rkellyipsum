<br>
Chillin in my four point six at the light <br>
Bout to be VIP for the night <br>
Shorty in the drop top V made a right <br>
Pull up to her bumper baby, beeped twice <br>
Jumped out the whip like I was the police <br>
Didn't have a gun, but my wrist said freeze <br>
Got Friday on a DVD <br>
She's a baller and I'm a baller <br>
Wha-what? <br>
<br>
<i>[1]</i> - To all my hot girls <br>
Livin' fiesta <br>
To all my hot boys <br>
Livin' fiesta <br>
To all my Chi town niggas <br>
Fiesta <br>
And all my uptown niggas <br>
Fiesta <br>
To all my players and my hustlers <br>
Fiesta <br>
And if you sittin' on them blades <br>
Fiesta <br>
To all my honeys in the club <br>
Fiesta <br>
And if you rollin' with a thug <br>
Fiesta <br>
<br>
We be off in the club sippin lot <br>
Red eye deep in the club puffin' Lye <br>
Strippers in the back of the club showing live <br>
Soon as I get a buzz I'm showing out <br>
House on top of the hill <br>
Counting what? <br>
Whose gonna buy the bar? <br>
Got enough <br>
Take the haters out in the back, rough 'em up <br>
I'm a baller now where's my ballers? <br>
Wha-what? <br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i> <br>
<br>
We pop Cris on a daily base <br>
Plus we got honeys all up in the place <br>
Bout to wild out in a major way <br>
So put your hands up if you made your pay <br>
Add a little juice to the Tangaray <br>
But let the ice show till the diamond fades <br>
Rockland sittin' on Capitol Hill <br>
Trackmaster make capital deals <br>
<br>
<i>[Gotti]</i> <br>
Now look at Gotti iced out with the blingy-bling <br>
And a big body sittin' on them gleamy things <br>
Now Rockland niggas know the means of cream <br>
Kelly, R&B Thug and it sings to king <br>
Got PJ niggas in caprime green <br>
(Thugged out) <br>
Hot chicks down to do anything <br>
Cop them mo chicks <br>
Cop mo bricks, pop mo Cris <br>
Ay Kelly drop mo hits <br>
<br>
<i>[Boo]</i> <br>
What you know about them cats <br>
That be spendin' the dough <br>
Every day drink Henney and a bottle of Mo' <br>
Ride whips, hittin' chicks <br>
Blowin' twenties on drough <br>
To the club thirty deep <br>
Plenty of ice to show <br>
Mami say she never rolled in a six before <br>
(Fiesta) <br>
Never seen a young cat this rich before <br>
Yeah Kelly made the way for these niggas to blow <br>
Thugged out, 2G, Rockland for sure <br>
