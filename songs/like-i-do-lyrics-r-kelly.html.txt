Listen shawty, can't nobody rock your body like the R
Listen shawty, can't nobody rock your body like the R
I ain't a doctor, can't save a life
To say I could I'd be outta my mind
I ain't no pro athlete, can't run for miles That's another thing I won't even
try
See, there's a lot of things that I can't do Can't hear mistakes, I make a lot
of But in a couple of categories I do I blow the competition out of the water
There's only 2 things in this world that I'm the best at, it's true Number 1 is
music and baby girl Number 2, can't nobody work your body out like I do, like I
do, like I do Can't nobody work your body out like I do, like I do, like I do
I ain't a painter, ain't got a brush To paint a portrait of love I ain't no
pilot, can't take you up So you can fly through the heavens above
See, there's a lot of things I can't do Can't hear mistakes, I make a lot of
But in a couple of categories I do I blow the competition out of the water
There's only 2 things in this world that I'm the best at, it's true Number 1 is
music and baby girl Number 2, can't nobody work your body out like I do, like I
do, like I do Can't nobody work your body out like I do, like I do, like I do
I can be your trainer, I can be your trainer Come in health club and baby, let
me train you Bend it over, stretch, stretch, stretch Baby, let me you train you

I can be your trainer, I can be your trainer Come in health club and baby, let
me train you Bend it over, stretch, stretch, stretch Baby, let me you train you

There's only 2 things in this world that I'm the best at, it's true Number 1 is
music and baby girl Number 2, can't nobody work your body out like I do, like I
do, like I do Can't nobody work your body out like I do, like I do, like I do
Gonna make your body say Come on baby, baby, oh baby Forget about it, baby
Listen shawty, can't nobody rock your body like the R
