Sick and tired of the games you played
Every move I make your ass got somethin' to say
Scandalize my name when you see it in the paper
Trying to turn it all around when it wasn't that way
Everybody is tryin' to figure me out What the hell is wrong with y'all? Just
let me live my life I can't go one day without y'all in my face Y'all have lost
y'all minds, if you don't hear what I say
Cops chase me when I'm standing still You know I ain't done shit wrong So why
you want me in your cell? You don't like my songs well, it pays the bills And
you cut me down 'cuz I keep it real
Sometimes I wanna fly far away from here To another place it ain't worth these
tears Sometimes at night when I close my eyes I know the haters are busy makin'
up hater lies
Sometimes I laugh tryin' to keep from cryin' If I was plain out of luck then
tell me who could I trust? See I work so hard just to get ahead If it wasn't
for God I'd probably be dead
Sometimes I think y'all tryin' to pull me down But y'all wastin' your time, I
got you haters figured out If you had your way it'd be lock and key Everywhere
I go trouble follows me Where the hell is my father? Shit, it hurts sometimes
There's a hole in me and it rocks my mind
Forgive me father for I have sinned When was your last confession?
His true fears he left without a care And that was more than I could bare When
you need my help I never tell you no When I need your love you got somewhere to
go
I'm gettin' sick of this shit but I'm not gonna quit I've come too far gotta
keep my pockets thick I get mad as hell but that's okay Kick off these shoes
'cuz I'm here to stay
I gotta let you know got no time to play So feel me and all that you hear me
say What I'm buildin' up, you can't tear it down 'Cuz it's built on solid
rockland ground
We don't die, we multiply Hit after hit, livin' platinum style Keep my head up
high, lookin' toward the sky Nothin' in my view, hey, I can fly
Y'all just hate I can't take no more And if you feel me Raise your hand and
show
This is what I feel Ooh, oh, oh, oh This is what I feel Feel me, feel me Feel
me, ooh, ooh Hey, hey, feel, ooh
West side tell me can you feel me? Hey, oh East side tell me can you feel me?
Whoa Oh, South, south side tell me can you feel me? Feel me, feel me, feel me,
feel me
