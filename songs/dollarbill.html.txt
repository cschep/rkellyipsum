Na-na so sick, make your toes twitch<br>
Get up in yo' ass and ride that shit<br>
Oh yeah, dare you act shady with the first lady?<br>
Let's go half on this baby<br>
Inner thighs thick so when we fuck you must put me in a Swiss ho'<br>
Room 704, fuck they mad at me fo'?<br>
Skin copper, na-na stay proper, who could stop her?<br>
Nuthin'. Hey, do a somersault<br>
All that platinum shit you bought?<br>
Nigga, fuck you thought, it ain't my fault<br>
Keep the wrist rocky, attitude cocky<br>
Next time you see me, address me like "Miss Foxy"<br>
It's for the wrist cop it, if it's a six drop it<br>
Thongs with topless how you like that Robbie?<br>
Ain't nothing sweet, you know my style, doggy style<br>
From the back, in the back, hit it like that<br>

Say what you want baby<br>
While you be stalling at the lights<br>

<i>[Foxy]</i><br>
Dollar bill <br>
<i>[R]</i><br>
Can get us from here to Rio<br>
In two hours first class still time to take a shower<br>
The dollar bill<br>
<i>[Foxy]</i><br>
Where ever we be it's VIP stats, no doubt<br>
So what y'all cats know about that<br>
<br>
<i>[R]</i><br>
Say lady, I'm liking what I see <br>
Come on and talk to me baby, baby, baby<br>
Can't you see one night is all I need<br>
We'll go somewhere and be <br>
Talkin' about your future plans with me<br>
<br>
<i>[Sparkle & Cynthia]</i><br>
I would do anything <br>
To have you in my life, that's right<br>
We can take a flight out of here go anywhere<br>
<br>
<i>[R]</i><br>
Uh uh, I got proof rims on the V-12 <br>
Make you raise the roof, no gold in the tooth<br>
Put some in the vault CD's overseas<br>
Private lofts, I'm you haters holocaust<br>
Ain't my fault I rap, then still made a mill'<br>
But it's my fault I got my own label deal<br>
Vacation in Japan while you wish for Bennihana's<br>
On the way to pick up Madona, the ill na-na<br>
<br>
<i>[Foxy]</i><br>
Now you know the na-na plays with the big boys, aye'day <br>
From the six coupe to the big Royce, can you handle that?<br>
A lotta sass and ass with that <br>
And I'm strickly for the dough<br>
So fuck you think I'm here fo'?<br>
Princesses in a row, row platinum status <br>
Ice lace to pink face<br>
Then I back the faggots<br>
See me rocking aye'thang from Mongolians to Persians <br>
Y'all still learning, I got Â¡Rem swervin', through a sermon<br>
And there's nuthin' you can tell me 'bout these cats that I<br>
Don't even ram through a plan, too much stack <br>
Must I continue this?<br>
Might be a couple of cats that I miss<br>
We could skip the french kiss, take it straight to the wrist <br>
And it gets no iller than this<br>
Na-na engraved on canary ice, see me wear it twice<br>
Did y'all niggas hear me right?<br>
Me and Kelly put the lock down on New York to Chitown <br>
His town to my town, for the dollar bill<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
<i>[Tone]</i><br>
Tell me who dat said dat we couldn't rock<br>
I roll the dice, bet the dots say we won't stop<br>
I roll from Chitown to Cali, hit your block<br>
I bless the day that R&B music meet hip hop<br>
You haters thought that Kelly couldn't keep it hot<br>
Even when I'm in your face, y'all see me not<br>
Sportin' nothing but the rocks, navigators on the block<br>
Merridian CD's with five TV's<br>
College honeys follow in your GS3<br>
We on the way to IHOP, coming from the spot<br>
Niggas in the lot jammin' to the knock<br>
Y'all mad cuz you can't get what we got<br>
Who's the number one contender, January through December?<br>
Cut your forest down while you niggas screamin' Timothy<br>
Sophia know me from the beach house in Miami<br>
Banks know me, so I could give a damn about the Grammies<br>
