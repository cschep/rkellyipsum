<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br>
Man, they go and tell me like<br>
you never know who your true friends until you ah umm<br>
both got a little bit of money<br>
I mean cause y'all both broke<br>
then there's no strain on the relationship, y'all both broke<br>
And if you got money and he ain't got no paper<br>
He still needs you so you'll never know how he really feel about you<br>
When y'all both get some paper, you'll see<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly + (Jay-Z)]</i><br>
We used to get money together, phone honies together<br>
Pushin chromed out twinkies in custom coach leather<br>
You claim it's all love, but nigga it's whatever<br>
Cause this is business, it ain't personal<br>
Same dream, same team, same schemes (mm)<br>
We even sold to the same damn fiends (how real is dat?)<br>
Ain't no rules in this war for this green<br>
This is business, and it ain't personal<br>
<br>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br>
Look, I'm a grown man dog<br>
And I ain't got time to be runnin behind y'all<br>
I know when I first started it was crazy to y'all<br>
"He's gon' start his own label, he'll never be able"<br>
Well, nigga you've been wrong before<br>
And you'll be wrong again if you bet against him<br>
We move through the hood like identical twins<br>
But it just so happen that a nigga made it rappin<br>
You showed your true colors, y'all niggaz stay yappin<br>
That don't stop him, a nigga weigh platinum<br>
Stop through the hood, to say what's happenin? (sup nigga)<br>
Fake hugz (uh-huh) fake whassup<br>
Fake love, fake fuck, fake thugs<br>
Gotta one myself for your fake shit, I raise up<br>
Hop in my wheels and I peel, streets are blazed up (uh-huh)<br>
About my bid'ness dog, y'all need to stay up - one<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus: R. Kelly]</i><br>
We used to get money together, phone honies together<br>
Pushin chromed out twinkies in custom coach leather<br>
You claim it's all love, but nigga it's whatever<br>
Cause this is business, it ain't personal<br>
Same dream, same team, same schemes<br>
We even sold to the same damn fiends<br>
Ain't no rules in this war for this green<br>
This is business, and it ain't personal<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br>
I wish, I wish - that success, we could all<br>
get a piece of it (word) but that ain't real dog (no)<br>
Cause in these streets it's war, the industry much more<br>
But rich or poor, I'ma keep it real my nigga<br>
Invest in chips and watch my money hill get bigger<br>
And do things like, pull up to some clubs<br>
in the skirts with Jigga, and yellin out HEY!<br>
What the fuck, pop that Cris' my nigga<br>
And then he wants to know how many chips I done sold<br>
Well it ain't y'all business what's behind my doors<br>
But y'all niggaz don't appreciate shit<br>
Helped you out and you still actin like a little bitch<br>
Then you wonder why I put yo' ass in the tenth row<br>
when you asked me for some tickets to my TP-2 show<br>
Lawwwwwwd tell me, why we don't like to see us grow<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus + ad libs]</i><br>
<br>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br>
A-Alike (uh-huh) be alike (that's right)<br>
We don't vibe no more because we don't C/see alike<br>
And your mom got it twisted, she think Hov' changed<br>
Nope; Hov's still here like Rogaine<br>
Ask your boy what he did to the Hov' game<br>
How he jeapordized the whole game<br>
Now when we see each other it's so strange<br>
I don't know whether to hug him or slug him (damn)<br>
I don't know whether to cap him or dap him<br>
I don't know what to think of him, I don't know what's happenin<br>
But what I do know, all the niggaz that you know<br>
locked up doin a few doe, but who knows?<br>
Maybe it wasn't you, maybe I'm buggin too (right)<br>
But I'm scared dog, I don't know what the fuck to do<br>
Do me a favor, place yourself in my shoes<br>
The game, no exceptions, gotta follow the rules<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
