Like a candle for this one
Light 'em up, my nigga, black pipe, come on
I've been around the world and gets nuthin' but love
For who I am, I thank my fans so much
And even though some may hate, still I appreciate All my friends and family,
that kept it real with me
I've been around the world and back like what up East side to west side tourin'
like what up And even though the price for the house was so much I still roll
with them from the hood like what up
'Cuz when it comes to bein' the realest I'm sho nuff I'm a straight up industry
villain fo sho nuff And I can't satisfy some a y'all no matter what And some a
y'all cats are soldier love
Said we livin' in a cold, cold world And ain't nuttin' but fake faces, fake
people, fake friends Said we livin' in a cold, cold world Where there ain't
nuttin' but envy wanna bees playa-hatas
Yea I know I need a hug but y'all need a hug too 'Cuz God gonna judge me the
same day He judge you And even though we have our struggles thats alright You
know we get our folks, it's gon' find a way to shine
Been around the world and gets nuthin' but love For who I am, I thank my fans
so much And even though some may hate, still I appreciate All my friends and
family, that kept it real with me
Sometimes this world can be so cold When you looking through the windows of the
soul I've been looking to see the truth as it unfolds 'Cuz I've been around
this globe and back enough to know the fact
Who loves me and who loves me not We be shits so hot, you could put it in red
tops And pump it through every hood, ghetto, and block Until they heart stops,
thats why they fiend for me
And I thank you for every blessing that you givin' me Lord And I'm grateful for
all my talent and my vocal accords And all these hatas I keep shakin 'em off
Rubbin' they face in fame, I'm sorry I changed the game But it's mine and I
can't complain
Rule and R Kelly, been around the world Puttin' it on women bumpin' and
grindin' these bitches But we always on time when a woman fed up And thats
love, thats why they all fuck wit us
Been around the world and gets nuthin' but love For who I am, I thank my fans
so much And even though some may hate, still I appreciate All my friends and
family, that kept it real with me
Said my lyrics is my testimony, thats how I live I had to get rid of a lotta
fake homies over the years You see me on TV sometimes, not how it is Y'all
gotta start learnin' how to separate me from showbiz
When I'm rollin' through your city, show me love And ladies when you see a boy,
give me love And though I'm not conceited, right It's just my space sometimes I
need it, right
Said I got so many friends in them area codes That I hand out them tickets when
it comes to my shows Ja let's break bread together, pray together That we grow
strong together
It's clear forever, help each other through the stormy weather Let's hurt
together, let's cry together And even if we grow together Then together we'll
make it better
Been around the world and gets nuthin' but love For who I am, I thank my fans
so much And even though some may hate, still I appreciate All my friends and
family that kept it real with me
Been around the world and gets nuthin' but love For who I am, I thank my fans
so much And even though some may hate, still I appreciate All my friends and
family that kept it real with me
