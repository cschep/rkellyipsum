Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant
Lay your body down and get you pregnant
Knock you up, pregnant, knock you up
Usually I leave the club with a girl who has a man And take her to a hotel for
just a one night stand See, I'm a playa so I ain't tryna take her on no dates
But much like my Patron, man, I'm just tryna take it straight
Until I met this girl in the club with an unbelievable booty Sweetest girl in
the world and I mean it and on top of that she's a cutie I ain't seen nothin'
like her around here in a while And if I had a girl she'd be the one to bear my
child
Tellin' myself I'm a playa so I keep tryna shake it off But I keep on seein'
this big old house with a picket fence and a dog Never felt nothin' like this,
she's more than a mistress I'm 'bout to handle my business then put that girl
in my kitchen
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant Girl, you make me wanna get you
pregnant Lay your body down and get you pregnant Knock you up, pregnant, knock
you up
All the pretty ladies please line up right next to me How would you like to go
on a little trip with your boy Tyrese Raise your hand if you want me to fulfill
your fantasies I can have you co-starrin' in one of my movies
Tell me what your name is, I can make you famous We can pop champagne and get
right down to sexin' Now I ain't got nothin' to do, tonight I got away for my
crew I just wanna put some in you and I can tell that you want it too

Ooh, this song has got me hungry, baby, baby So tell me that you want me, baby,

make you my mine
Around the world in and out of clubs hangin' with chicks And I don't see
nothin' wrong with havin' a kid Sounds like heaven's callin' us And girl, well,
it's about makin' love
If you choose me I guarantee That the rest of your life would be man drama free
I think both of us should leave this club And get somewhere alone with me Where
there's no phones to ring and plant this magic seed
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant Girl, you make me wanna get you
