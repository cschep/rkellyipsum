I was riding in my car one day (Oh) In the express lane, rolling down the
freeway And suddenly the phone rings Then I reached down beside me
Then I looked on the floor, fell on the back seat See, I was drinking while I
was driving Never thinking 'bout what I was doing I turned around and before I
knew it Here comes this truck now
The doctor said, I dont think hes gonna make it Family said, Make the
funeral arrangements Unplug the machine, hes gone now Then told my wife to be
strong now
Then a small voice said on to me If you promise to stop drinking I
surrendered on that day And for 10 years, Ive been straight
You saved me, You saved me (Whoa) You saved me, You saved me, gave me a second
chance You saved me, You saved me You saved me, You saved me
Now Ive been sitting in the chair Waiting on the phone to ring Praying up to
God that someone Would call me with a job opening
'Cause it's been so hard for me month to month Struggling to eat but still
there was no answer (No answer) I stopped believing in His word and got so mad
at Him When somebody say God's good, I just laugh at them (Oh yeah)
And in the nick of time, His blessing rained on me By His grace the phone ring
A lady says, We're hiring And thats when I knew
You saved me, You saved me (Saved me) You saved me, You saved me, gave me a
second chance You saved me, You saved me You saved me, You saved me
Now I was 18, out on the block selling drugs With a gun at my waist and for
people had no love See, the streets was my home and family and friends were
gone Had no one to trust and deep inside, I was all alone
And then a deal went bad one day and it was enough to pause me I was shot 4
times and before I knew it, I was on my knees (Blood gushing out my body, my
heart's beatin' fast I dont know what Ima do, I dont think Im gonna last)
Then I began to flash back on the things Ive done in my past (Then I heard a
small voice that said to me Ill give you peace if you believe) I accepted
Christ that day, hallelujah, now Im free
You saved me, You saved me (Saved) You saved me, You saved me, gave me a second
chance You saved me, You saved me You saved me, You saved me
I was in the aisle of the grocery store With a pain in my chest and Im
wondering where did it come from (I got tested) And the results came back and
the doctor said Im sorry but you got cancer
I could not believe it, so I called up my mama to calm my nerve (Mama) She got
down on her knees, she said a prayer for me (Mama)
(Mama) Said just keep on thanking Jesus, Hell give you all you need (Mama)
That was five years ago, dont have that pain no mo' Doc says, You can go home
'cause all your cancer's gone
You saved me, You saved me (Said, You saved me) You saved me, You saved me,
gave me a second chance You saved me, You saved me You saved me, You saved me
