Hey baby...<br>
What you doin'?<br>
Well, stay there.<br>
I got a surprise for you.<br>
I'm on my way over.<br>
<br>
Suddenly I feel like I wanna break loose<br>
Jump in my six and come and see you<br>
Girl, I'm gonna do something that's brand new<br>
Umm, I got a kinky surprise for you<br>
So girl get ready cuz I'm on my way<br>
Put your sexy body in some negligee<br>
And if you feel me, let me know it right now<br>
Baby, this is how it's all going down<br>
<br>
There'll be<br>
Three knocks at the door, my baby<br>
My trench coat hits the floor, my baby<br>
Sit back in the chair, my baby<br>
Cuz I'm about to go there, my baby<br>
And get your body real open, baby<br>
Do what you been hopin', baby<br>
Tonight I'm gonna pull a switcheroo<br>
Do you mind if I strip for you?<br>
<br>
Now I'ma stop and get some gas, my baby<br>
That gives you time to freshen up, my baby<br>
And if you want, just leave the door unlocked<br>
I'll be creepin' in 'bout 12 o'clock<br>
So turn the telephones off, my baby<br>
No interruptions while I'm driving you crazy<br>
Girl, I want you to know tonight is yours<br>
Start in the bed and end up on the floor<br>
<br>
There'll be<br>
Three knocks at the door, my baby (three knocks)<br>
Trench coat hits the floor, my baby<br>
(Sit back) Sit back in the chair, my baby<br>
(Oh) Cuz I'm about to go there, my baby<br>
(And get your body) And get your body real open, baby<br>
(Do what) Do what you been hopin', baby<br>
(Tonight) Tonight I'm gonna pull a switcheroo<br>
(Do you) Do you mind if I strip for you?<br>
<br>
<i>[BRIDGE:]</i><br>
Baby, watch this<br>
Slowly rolling<br>
For you (for you)<br>
Whatever you want me to do<br>
I will do<br>
Girl, I promise<br>
Will not regret<br>
(You won't regret it)<br>
I'm everything that you ever wanted<br>
I'ma strip to the bone<br>
And just let you get on it, girl<br>
<br>
Three knocks at the door, my baby (three knocks)<br>
My trench coat hits the floor, my baby<br>
(Just sit back) Sit back in the chair, my baby<br>
(Relax) Cuz I'm about to go there, my baby<br>
(About to go there) And get your body real open, baby<br>
(Open) Do what you been hopin', baby<br>
(Tonight) Tonight I'm gonna pull a switcheroo<br>
(Oh hoo) Do you mind if I strip for you?<br>
<br>
(You)<br>
Three knocks at the door, my baby<br>
(I bet three knocks, I bet three knocks)<br>
My trench coat hits the floor, my baby<br>
(Baby just sit back)<br>
Sit back in the chair, my baby<br>
(I'm about)<br>
Cuz I'm about to go there, my baby<br>
(Get you open, girl)<br>
And get your body real open, baby<br>
(What you been hopin', girl)<br>
Do what you been hopin', baby<br>
Tonight I'm gonna pull a switcheroo<br>
(Pull a switcheroo)<br>
(Do you mind)<br>
Do you mind if I strip for you?<br>
(If I strip for you)<br>
