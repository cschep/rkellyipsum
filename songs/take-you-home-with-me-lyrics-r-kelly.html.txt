I call mami Montana, bandana Tied her hands up, this is gangsta love
Threw on a rap CD, we gangsta fucked This ain't R&B smooth, I ain't a R&B dude
Poured a glass of Army, got mami in the mood Then she stripped for me like the
'Moulin Rouge'

Add mami to the cypher R.O.C. for life 'cause the gang motherfucker

bitch with speed I make the next bitch, see the exit indeed Gotta know you're
verily respected by me
You get the keys to the Lexus but no drive You get your own 2002, she through
ridin' Keep yo' ass tighter than Versace That's why you gotta watch yo' friends

little body-adi-adi (Do you want it?)
Girl I wanna freak your body-adi-adi (What you want it?) I just wanna take you

Uh, yeah Mami shot through the pad with the Mark Jacobs bag The thick stitched
seam and her favorite ass jeans Y'all know the first date wearers
To make objects bigger than they appear like a rear-view mirror Oh, her shoe
 With the four-
inch heels
But honestly my favorite type of gear Is a scrungy for her hair and LaPearla
underwear, clear?
Girl, I hear you callin', let's stop stallin' Do what we came to do Girl I hear
you callin', let's stop stallin' Baby I want you, yeah
