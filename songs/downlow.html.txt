Listen girl you want me but he needs you<br>
Yet you're tellin' me that everything is cool<br>
Tryin' to convince me baby to do as you say<br>
Just go along and see things your way<br>
<br>
<i>[1]</i> - And keep it on the down low <br>
Nobody has to know<br>
We can keep it on the down low<br>
Nobody has to know<br>
<br>
Secret lovers is what you wanna be<br>
While making love to him girl you're silently calling on me<br>
What is a man to do in a situation like this?<br>
I feel there is something that I don't wanna miss<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
Beautiful you are but you're his by far<br>
Comin' by my way drivin' his fancy car<br>
Making plans to be in my life forever<br>
Tell me, tell me that we'll always be together<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
Listen babe I won't whisper a word
