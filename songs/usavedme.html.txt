I was riding in my car one day<br>
In the express lane rollin on the freeway<br>
And suddenly the phone rings then I<br>
Reached down beside me then i look<br>
On the floor felt on the backseat<br>
See I was drinking while I was driving<br>
Never thinking bout what I was doing<br>
I turned around and before i knew it<br>
Here comes this truck now<br>
<br>
Doctor said don't think he gonna make it<br>
Family said make the funeral arrangements<br>
Unplug the machine he's gone now <br>
Then told my wife to be strong now<br>
Then a small voice said told me<br>
If you promise to stop drinking<br>
I surrendered on that day<br>
Now for ten years i've been straight<br>
<br>
You saved me <i>[4x]</i><br>
Gave me a second chance<br>
You saved me <i>[3x]</i><br>
You saved me<br>
<br>
Now i've been sitting in this chair<br>
Waiting on the phone to ring<br>
Praying up to God that someone will call<br>
Me with a job opening<br>
Cause it's been so hard for me<br>
Month to month struggling to eat<br>
But still there was no answer<br>
I stop believing in his word and<br>
Got so mad at him and<br>
When somebody said God's good<br>
I just laugh at 'em<br>
<br>
But in the nick of time his blessing<br>
Rain on me<br>
By his grace the phone ring<br>
A lady said were hiring and <br>
That's when I knew<br>
<br>
You saved me <i>[4x]</i><br>
<br>
Now i was 18 out there on the block<br>
Selling drugs<br>
With a gun at my waist<br>
And for people I had no love<br>
See the streets was my home<br>
Family and friends were all gone<br>
Had no one to trust<br>
And deep inside i was all alone<br>
And a deal went bad one day<br>
And it was enough to pause me<br>
I was shot 4 times and before i<br>
Knew it I was on my knees<br>
<br>
Blood pushin out my body<br>
My heart's beating faster don't know what i'm gonna do<br>
I don't think i'm gonna last then<br>
I begain to flash back on the things<br>
I done in my past<br>
Then I heard a small voice that said<br>
I'll give you peace if you believe<br>
I accepted Christ that day<br>
Halilujah now i'm free<br>
<br>
You saved me <i>[4x]</i><br>
<br>
I was in the aisle of the grocery store<br>
With a pain in my chest and I'm wondering<br>
Where did it come from (I got tested)<br>
And the results came back <br>
And the doctor said i'm sorry but u got cancer<br>
I could not beleive it so <br>
I call my mama to calm my nerves<br>
<br>
(mama) she got down on her knees<br>
(mama) she said a prayer for me<br>
(mama) just keep on thanking Jesus<br>
(mama) he'll give you what you need<br>
(thank you Jesus)<br>
Now that was five years ago<br>
I don't have that pain no more<br>
Doc said you can go home<br>
Cause all your cancer's gone<br>
<br>
You saved me <i>[4x]</i><br>
<br>
You saved me (said you saved me)<br>
You saved me (but you saved me)<br>
You saved me saaaved me<br>
Gave me a second chance (second chance)<br>
Halilujah saved me<br>
Saved me saved me<br>
Wooooooh You saved me<br>
<br>
You gave me it was by grace You saved me<br>
I'm so thankful that You looked down on me<br>
Saw me standing there<br>
I was at the end of my rope no where to go<br>
And you gave me<br>
<br>
No where to go (and you saved me)<br>
I was down and out 2 <br>
I was doing drugs 2<br>
I was running the streets 2<br>
Never felt love<br>
I was wilding out<br>
You saved me<br>
You stepped in ooh save me<br>
<br>
You saved me
