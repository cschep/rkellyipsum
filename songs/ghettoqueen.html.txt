Crucial Conflict come out and play, hey come on<br>
Crucial Conflict, Kelly and Rockland, collabo'<br>
<br>
Funny faces is all I see<br>
At my place, you on top of me<br>
Playin' strip poker, sippin' Cristi'<br>
I grip your shoulders, you sqeeze the sheets<br>
I'm admirin' your heart shaped booty<br>
Nothin' in your oven, baby feed me now<br>
Who's is this, who's is this, who's is this<br>
Who's is this, who's is this, who's is this<br>
My ghetto queen<br>
<br>
<i>[1]</i> - You're my ghetto queen<br>
Right around the way from me<br>
Watering those ghetto trees<br>
We be high just like them weeds<br>
<br>
Might be ghetto but you queen to me <br>
That's how it's suppose to be<br>
Do whatcha gotta do for me <br>
Forever fulfill your fantasy<br>
When you think of me, have your cream<br>
Everything my team must to do one thing<br>
You're the meanest queen on the scene<br>
Make a player 'fien and be havin' dreams<br>
For real, it's real as it seems<br>
You bring the trees, I'll bring the B's<br>
<br>
Begin to freeze on to me, you can scream to please<br>
Plus I'm ready now, take a stand, got me on Rockland<br>
I can be your freaky man, you can climb in, suck a 10<br>
Want some ends? You outta there<br>
No more funny face, put you in your place<br>
Come be the dinner, I'm a bring a plate<br>
<br>
She's my ghetto girl in her own world, she's a queen<br>
Queen of all things, for that I mean she's Spring<br>
Personality rings bells in my dreams<br>
Night to dawn, light spread tight, let's swing<br>
Grip it in motion, wet coastin' with a little bit of ridin' rough<br>
Up and down we stroke, strokin' puttin' things in her pocket is fat<br>
But watch her stay cool, calm and collected<br>
Flexin', check it, never was on that stressin'<br>
Cuz she bring that hay for the day, what a blessin'<br>
Right around the way from me<br>
This ghetto queen got up with a king<br>
Keep it clean and in essence<br>
<br>

<i>[Kilo]</i><br>
Where the players live<br>
Have to deal with the Macks <br>
Like the traps in the concrete jungle<br>
Life's a safari in the mornin' huntin'<br>
In effect, your pulse beatin' like bongos<br>
We be like this, gettin' high<br>
Ghetto queen you look so delightin'<br>
Heard your body callin', callin' me, baby <br>
Tellin' me to rodeo ride it<br>
Don't fall off, hold on<br>
Get your roll on, step aside, hugged her back<br>
She swore she wouldn't do me, need your loyalty<br>
You're makin' me wantin' to snap<br>
I know your man is mad as hell<br>
Cuz it to a player and I did it well<br>
And I added one more for the road, to let 'em know<br>
Kilo weigh heavy on the scale, mmm<br>
<br>
<i>[Wyldstyle]</i><br>
Dedicated to my ghetto queens in jeans,<br>
That think they're mean<br>
I'll massage you with whip cream<br>
I wanna spread you legs and said you were my lady<br>
Down with me, clown with me, fall to the ground with me<br>
Lovin' how you sound when we get 'em off<br>
Carry on to the dawn, give a dog a bone (lick 'em low)<br>
Rodeo show, duckin' you, buckin' in the back of a Cadillac<br>
Tell me if you want it like that (let's bang)<br>
Got me tweakin' Mary Jane, it's a hay thang<br>
Me and you, everyday keep it high like flames (your game)<br>
What's my name? What's my name?<br>
It's Wyldstyle from Chitown, no shame<br>
Me and the ghetto queen comin' up the main<br>
Switchin' four lanes, to the airplane<br>
Sky high we fly when we roll by<br>
On the down low, doin' my thang man<br>
