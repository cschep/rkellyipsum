Baby, now I realize
All of those times I told you I loved you
I just didn't show it I'm sorry
Don't put me out
Don't put me out Don't put me out
I remember when you said to me Don't talk about it be about it I should have
felt you when you said to me That you were all alone
I act like I was doing a favor For you 'cuz you were with me Something let me
thinking that whatever happens This would be my home but I was wrong How could
I have been so low? I wrote a song all about it Wanna hear it, here we go, from
now on
I won't talk about lovin' you 'Cuz I'm gonna be about lovin' you I won't talk
about comin' home 'Cuz I'm gonna be about comin' home I won't talk about both
of us 'Cuz I'm gonna be about both of us I won't talk about makin' sweet love
'Cuz I'm gonna be about makin' sweet love
Now I remember when we used the crib in Studio 12A Clothes and pallets on the
floor makin' sweet love night till day Used to say I wanna have a baby boy and
call him, "Man" But now it's all gone up in smoke and baby, I don't understand
All I know that is I was wrong How could I have stooped so low? I wrote a song
about it All about it, wanna hear it Here we go, from now on
I won't talk about lovin' you 'Cuz I'm gonna be about lovin' you I won't talk
about comin' home 'Cuz I'm gonna be about comin' home I won't talk about both
of us 'Cuz I'm gonna be about both of us I won't talk about makin' sweet love
'Cuz I'm gonna be about makin' sweet love
Now all the money in the world could not add up to what you did 'Cuz when I was
down and out you took the burden off of me I never thought that when I took her
out somehow it'd cause me pain I was rooming at the Drake, how the hell you
found my name?
Damn, I was wrong How could I have stooped so low? I wrote a song All about it,
wanna hear it Here we go, from now on
I won't talk about lovin' you 'Cuz I'm gonna be about lovin' you I won't talk
about comin' home 'Cuz I'm gonna be about comin' home I won't talk about both
of us 'Cuz I'm gonna be about both of us I won't talk about makin' sweet love
'Cuz I'm gonna be about makin' sweet love I won't talk about lovin' you 'Cuz
I'm gonna be about lovin' you
Girl, open up the door and let me in this house Please baby, I'm tired of
banging on this door The neighbors say I'm loud, honey, I beg of you
Don't put me out Don't put me out Don't put me out ...
