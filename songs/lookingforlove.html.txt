Out of all the girls I've loved before<br>
Out of all the stages I've performed on<br>
Out of all of the cities I've been to<br>
I bless the day that I found you <br>
<br>
I bless the day I found you and that's my word<br>
It's nothing for me out there in those streets<br>
You took my heart and you set it on fire<br>
And now my love forever burns<br>
You keep taking me higher<br>
<br>
<i>[1]</i> - I been looking for love<br>
In all the wrong places<br>
And now I finally found <br>
Someone who cares for me<br>
No matter the storm<br>
It was you who helped me face it<br>
And now it's safe to say<br>
That you really care for me<br>
<br>
Just like the wings <br>
You took me, flew me away, yeah<br>
And now my ground is underneath my feet<br>
This man had nowhere to go<br>
Then you gave me direction<br>
And now the rest of my days<br>
I can't help but give you the praise<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
You saw my needs, forgave my faults<br>
You cleansed my heart, you changed my thoughts<br>
You brought the sun into my life<br>
When my world had seemed dark, yes you did<br>
And you're the only one <br>
Who was there when I needed a friend<br>
You're the only one who can place joy<br>
When there's pain in my heart<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i>
