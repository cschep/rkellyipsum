Had the landlord at my door
I heard him saying
Tomorrow no more
Pay me now or leave
But we didn't have anything to give?(ah can you feel me) Searching for
restoration?(and we need restoration) Make the church my family This is my
story This is my song And I can sing it all night long?I tell you why because
The ghetto is a part of my religion?(the only thing my eyes can see) The only
thing my eyes can see?(and I tell you there aint no man) There aint no man
gonna stop the vision?(I'm a part of the ghetto) The ghetto is a part of me
Children cry no more?(children cry no more) Because heaven is upon you Please
put down your guns And we shall overcome Thought your load may be heavy Know
that the weight makes you strong Take my life for example While I sing my song
Mr. Kelly help me sing this song?
The ghetto is a part of my religion?(the only thing my eyes can see) The only
thing my eyes can see?(and I tell you there aint no man) There aint no man
gonna stop the vision?(I'm a part of the ghetto) The ghetto is a part of me
The ghetto is a part of my religion?(the only thing my eyes can see) The only
thing my eyes can see?(and I tell you there aint no man) There aint no man
gonna stop the vision?(I'm a part of the ghetto) The ghetto is a part of me
La la la la la lala la?
La la la la la lala la?
La la la la la lala la?
The ghetto is a part of me The ghetto is a part of my religion
