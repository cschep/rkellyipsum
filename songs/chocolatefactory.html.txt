When I discovered you I discovered a piece within, joy like no other,<br>
you're my closest friend,<br>
if you were a number you'd be a perfect 10<br>
right out of the skies you were heaven sent.<br>
the way we make love over and over again<br>
if I had to describe you I wouldn't know where to begin<br>
I am so proud to be your next of kin<br>
you prayed over me when I had no reason to live<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br>
candy caramel coated taffies chocolate covered strawberries,<br>
love so sweet, your my chocolate factory<br>
gum drops mixed with chocolate milk bars, theres so much variety<br>
love so sweet, your my chocolate factory<br>
<br>
now if I could write a book on how you make me feel<br>
the tittle would be strong black man, and that's for real<br>
you got me going round and round like a ferries wheel<br>
in and out of relationships and baby your the deal,<br>
ain't nobody on god's green earth for me, heaven stirred us up together<br>
and made the perfect chemistry, wouldn't change you for the world as long as I exist.<br>
Always in the kitchen cooking my favorite meal.<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus x3]</i>
