<i>[R.]</i><br>
Uh huh, hey, I remember when I back in the days <br>
When I ain't hot shit<br>
But now that I got shit<br>
Niggas wanna keep up shit<br>
But it's all good, watch me do this shit<br>
<br>
<i>[Cam'Rom]</i><br>
Yo, yo, yo, yo, ay yo, from my town to Chitown<br>
R. Kelly got some thugs to make you lock down<br>
Voice cry hot sounds tied down cop twisters<br>
Shop lifters with Benini schemes<br>
Smoke greenie green candyman up in cabrini green<br>
Some cats I know like to splurge on they wrists<br>
But my man karate man cut the nerves out his fist<br>
But yo, throw your hands up y'all it's just love in here<br>
It ain't shit but a thug affair<br>
I'm at the bar spendin' thug money<br>
Cop so much huh, they say I love money carats like bugs bunny<br>
So lets slide you got the right thong<br>
Dju don't know, I'm all night long<br>
The DJ playing all the right songs<br>
To the BM, REM's are Muy bien<br>
It's R. Kelly, killer Cam'<br>
Baby girl, can you dig now<br>
Next time we see him yo, we laying Mr. Biggs down<br>
<br>
<i>[1]</i> - To all my players and my thugs<br>
To all my honeys in the club<br>
To all the hoods that show me love<br>
We ride, we ride<br>
(From Chitown to LA)<br>
To all my ballers lockin' ice, getting a room for the night<br>
Taking first class flights, we ride, we ride<br>
(From Chitown to LA)<br>
<br>
<i>[Noreaga]</i><br>
Yo, I used to be in Chitown and collect panties<br>
When I make cabrini green you know I hit Sammy's<br>
Thugged out yo, all my people givin' eye jammies<br>
Now them shorties say I'm cute, when they can't stand me<br>
R. Kelly yo, I'm right from the belly, you know the soul<br>
Everything that we spit on is platinum gold<br>
But now it's for the love, for all the players and the thugs<br>
Yo, it's a party goin' on, meet me right at the club<br>
We got some chickens in the living room getting it on<br>
And they ain't leaving 'till six in the morning<br>
Thugged out, my people gettin' head while we on and<br>
Tear the club up every time we performin'<br>
Gun up in your waist, please don't shoot up the place<br>
Because this shorty right here, lookin' good in my face<br>
Ay yo, it's so deep I told shorty just last week<br>
Uh huh, it's like, you remind me of my jeep<br>

<i>[Vegas Cats]</i><br>
Only ballers be allowed up in here<br>
Money makers got my thug niggas watchin' my rear for player haters<br>
Eighteen and I'm livin' a dream, go figure<br>
How a nigga that's younger than you, ice bigger<br>
Don't sweat that, stick to rap nigga, try that<br>
Call my nigga R. Kell if you need a hit, black<br>
And when you get it, make it known baby, who did it<br>
It'll make your fans hit the stores and go get it<br>
Now, here come a bitter sweet note for the fellas<br>
Left out the club with her friend, now she jealous<br>
Mad cuz she can't ride in the LS<br>
Yeah, she kinda mad but a baller could care less<br>
While you sleep, sleep, sleep<br>
I'm inna Benz going beep, beep, beep<br>
Got your girl sayin' "Yo, who he?"<br>
So let's ride to Rockland's party, uh huh<br>
<br>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br>
Check, Ghetto pro' federal<br>
Jay-Z shake the dice, let 'em go<br>
Bet a load I tear down every show<br>
Better know cheddar crowed like the front babe row<br>
Says R., Jay y'all, all I need is four bars<br>
I'm hotter than a lotta men<br>
Switch up cars like Rodman's hair color, then hit your broad<br>
I'm borderline too much for the mortal mind<br>
Every time you ought to rewind, find there's more to find <br>
Now pop that cork, then pour the wine<br>
Represent New York to Chitown, like what<br>
Floss mine, like of course my, what<br>
Never cross my family, can we all get along? Hell no<br>
I'm tryin' to tell y'all who dat is that rule that biz<br>
Not your baby daddy but Jay-Z, true that is<br>
Better school that kid on who's shoes that is<br>
Or who I be nigga, V.I.P Jigga<br>
