Uh, uhh uhh, Kel's
Young, M, X, tra, money, let's go

Where you get your little body-adi-adi (do you want it?)
Girl I wanna freak your body-adi-adi (what you want it?) I just wanna take you
home with me Girl you know you got a body-adi-adi (do you like it?)
She get it
from her momma.. We lay back, blowin ganja DVD, she make it hard to watch a
flat TV - WHOA I crept up behind her Mami threw it like a quarterback, I caught
that like Rice I call mami Montana, bandana Tied her hands up - this is gangsta
love Threw on a rap CD, we gangsta fucked Poured a glass of Army, got mami in
the mood This ain't R&B smooth, I ain't a R&B dude Then she stripped for me
like the "Moulin Rouge" I think I might wife her Y'know, powder blue Roc-a-Wear
suit, white Nike her Add mami to the cypher R.O.C. for life 'cause, the gang
motherfucker
[Chorus
I make ya hotter than the next bitch - no need for you to ever sweat the next
bitch - with speed [ From: http://www.metrolyrics.com/take-you-home-with-me-
 I make the next bitch see the exit - indeed
Gotta know you're ver-ily respected - by me You get the keys to the Lexus - but
no drive You get your own 2002, she through ridin Keep yo' ass tighter than
Versace That's why you gotta watch yo' friends See I just wanna freak your
body-adi-adi You gotta watch me, they connivin shit But everybody ain't as
horny as me I know you don't do this for everybody-adi And your body's -
callin, me...

[Chorus
Mami shot through the pad with the Mark Jacobs bag to make objects bigger than
they appear like a rearview mirror Y'all know the first date wearers Oh her
shoe game is real But honestly my favorite type of gear She gave 'em the
Christian Libountins(?) with the four inch heels is a scrungy for her hair and
LaPearla underwear, clear?
Do what we came to do Baby
I want you, yeah Girl I hear you callin, let's stop stallin
[Chorus
