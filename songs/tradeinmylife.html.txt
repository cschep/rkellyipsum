<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
Trade in my life <br>
Oh for you, oh yes, oh yes<br>
Trade in my life for you<br>
<br>
Sittin' here wonderin' how did things go wrong<br>
Every night asking myself what happened to our happy home<br>
Will I ever see you again, I need to know my friend<br>
Now the past has gone away but tomorrow's on it's way<br>
Though the sun is going down, I need you around<br>
I'm willing to trade in my life<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
Now I'm sitting here <br>
Reminiscing on what we used to share<br>
And how we used to be such a happy pair, oh yeah<br>
I cannot believe we've thrown it all away<br>
Tell me will I see you again someday?<br>
<br>
Now the past is gone away <br>
But tomorrow's on it's way<br>
Though the sun is going down<br>
And I need you around - trade<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
<br>
We both know that we made a vow <br>
Said we'd always be together<br>
That our love would endure, yes<br>
But now you're gone and I'm all alone<br>
But I need you here and I'm willing to trade it<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
<br>
I mean it from the bottom of my heart<br>
Tell me are you with me, are you willing to trade it<br>
<br>
And I don't even have to think about it twice<br>
Hey, I'll trade it<br>
Somebody help me say I'll trade it<br>
Until you return to me<br>
I'm gonna stay on my hands and knees<br>
And when I see you I'm gonna stand up<br>
And reach my hands out to you, and trade it<br>
<br>
Said I love my music and I love my fans<br>
But I've got to step back<br>
Look at this thing like it sure enough is<br>
Tell me do you remember when we used to say<br>
Everything is in their love tell me<br>
<br>
What does it profit a man<br>
To gain the world and lose his soul?<br>
I'm gonna trade it to be with you
