You have reached R. Kelly
Unfortunately I'm asleep
Been out partying all night
And I'm blasted off that Hennessey
I hop to hotel lobbies Going to them after-parties Throwing up and carrying on
'Bout to have somebody drive me home
I get through the door, fall on the floor Get up, I'm staggering Look upstairs
Shit is blurry because I'm real bent
And now I don't know whether I'm coming or going And this goes out to all of my
Honeys that's calling

not asleep or

baby

not faded or Making a baby
Drinking Belvedere, 7-Up, and gin I told myself never again Sleeping while the
club is crunk Don't make no sense to be that drunk
Arguing through the night Pushing on people and starting fights I was fucked
up, I confess People saying Kellz is a hot mess
Even after that I was taking shots Shot after shot Shot after shot then I
couldn't even open the door to my Benz
Dropped off and I get in the door now Lying on the stairs snoring now Why you
calling me, calling me, calling me? (Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up Kellz)
Why you calling me, calling me, calling me? (Pick it up, pick it up, pick it
up) But I'm knocked out on sleep

after) Sure to get back with you (Yeah) If I'm not asleep or (No)
