I was so wrapped up in
All of the finer things
That I never took the time to show you
What you meant to me
Money, cars and ice Blingin' off the clothes I thought that I was hot Until you
turned cold
How could my success? Go and deceive me If I could turn it all back Then all of
this would be a dream to me
Baby, baby If you saw me in church on Sundays You could tell I've learn my
lesson well
Never said a prayer Oh like this Never shed a tear Until it was you I missed
Never fell in love Like a bottomless pit I was so, so tough Till you were up
and outta here
My pride had me thinking That being with me you were blessed Funny how you
could ask for so little And receive less
All of the fussing and fighting 'Cause I was always gone And even though I gave
you a lame excuse You still hung on
Oh, I don't blame you for leaving me But if I could turn it all back This would
be a dream to me
Baby, baby, baby If you could see me in church on Sundays You would say I've
learned my lesson well
Never said a prayer Never said a prayer like this no, no Never shed a tear
Until it was you I missed
Never fell in love Like a bottomless pit I was so, so tough Till you were up
and outta here
Never said a prayer Said a prayer like this baby Never shed a tear Until it was
you I missed
Never fell in love I was so, so tough Till you were up and outta here
Never said a prayer Said I never said a prayer like this Never shed a tear To
tough to shed a tear ooh baby
Never fell in love They could take all my positions hey Never said a prayer
Because love taught me a lesson baby
(Never shed a tear) See I've got to have you back (Never fell in love) See I've
got to have you back See I've got to have you back
(Never said a prayer) See I've got to have you back See I've got to have you
back
(Never shed a tear) Got to have you, got to have you Got to have you, got to
have you (Never fell in love) Got to have you, got to have you Got to have you,
got to have you Got to have you, hey oh
Never said a prayer Never shed a tear Never fell in love
