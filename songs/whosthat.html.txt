<i>[verse 1 - R. Kelly:]</i><br>
Sitting at the bar with mama<br>
Shorty tryin to bring da drama<br>
But she cannot phase a playa<br>
Cuz this pimp is a moneymaker<br>
<br>
Meetings from Shawtown to LA<br>
Yo I came to get down at this party<br>
I got my eyes on Keesha and Shante'<br>
Rolling it like this track was raggae<br>
<br>
<i>[pre - hook:]</i><br>
I roll thru the hottest club!<br>
With about a hundred thugs!<br>
Get about a thousand bucks<br>
For chicks who wanna roll on dubs<br>
<br>
<i>[chorus - R. Kelly:]</i><br>
Yo, whose that in the jeep (some mami's)<br>
Whose that off up in the truck (my n***az)<br>
Yo what ya'll doin' tonight (we thuggin')<br>
Yo what's off up in that cup (some liquior)<br>
<br>
Well, I'm rollin' with ya'll (we'll let's go)<br>

Now lemme hit that pace (for shizzle)<br>
Shorty can we make our day<br>
<br>
<i>[verse 2 - R. Kelly:]</i><br>

Looking for the biggest booty<br>

<i>[break - R.Kelly:]</i><br>
Yo, yo, yo, yo<br>

Mami in passenger, spilling the champagne<br>
We stop at a red light, she driving me insane<br>
Yo we fiending like the **** was ****<br>
Stop playin girl the way ya shake a fatty back<br>
So sexy the way you telling daddy that<br>
Turn that a** around and lemme patty that<br>

<br>
<i>[Rap - Fat Joe:]</i><br>
Oh no! They did it again (who?!)<br>

Damuses, wamuses, big Bahamas's<br>
All kind of missis <br>
Don't matter ya ma misses<br>
What's love got to do with ****in' there<br>
Everyday a new group of chicks there<br>
We headed to the islands, the games is life<br>
Where the fame is<br>
Shorty almost died when we came there<br>
Girl I know you diggin the ditty dop<br>
This my world come thru<br>
The whole city stop<br>
Looks like ice but actually it's really not<br>
Damos, blandes, no lies around me<br>

In the south bronx where you can find me<br>
