Close your eyes, now relax your mind
Now I want you to picture yourself far, far away
(Throw your thoughts aside, 'cause we're about to take a ride)
And I dont want you to have a care in the world right now
Its just you and me, in this moment, quiet, listen
Baby, take your mind into a zone Imagine that we're all alone Two ways off and
our friends are gone Now picture you and me getting it on
Take my hand and come with me Lets indulge in fantasies Cast your cares and
worries And slowly fall into this ecstasy
Im gonna rub your body, so baby, just relax Youve been pouring out your
lovin' And now it's time to pour it back
Imagine that (Imagine that, imagine that) (Imagine that, imagine, imagine that)
All night long me strokin' your body, imagine that (Imagine that, imagine that)
(Imagine that, imagine, imagine that)
Whipped cream and strawberries, know what I mean (Imagine that, imagine that)
(Imagine that, imagine, imagine that) Candles and oils surroundin' the bed
(Imagine that, imagine that) (Imagine that, imagine, imagine that) And me
kissin' your body from feet to head
Imagine that, we dont have to talk Lay your body here and watch my fingers
walk Take a second and imagine the opportunity You and me sharin' sexual energy
Now girl, just meditate on you being in this chair Then close your eyes and act
like we not even here, girl
Im gonna rub your body, so baby just relax Youve been pourin' out your lovin'
And now it's time to pour it back
Imagine (Imagine that, imagine that) (Imagine that, imagine, imagine that) Me
stroking your body (Imagine that, imagine that) Imagine that (Imagine that,
imagine, imagine that)
Strawberries and whipped cream, you know what I mean (Imagine that, imagine
that) (Imagine that, imagine, imagine that) Candles and oils surroundin' the
bed (Imagine that, imagine that) (Imagine that, imagine, imagine that) Me
kissin' you from feet to head, yeah
You like that? Yeah, I like that
(Imagine that, imagine that) (Imagine that, imagine, imagine that) Baby, that
Im strokin' your body, imagine that (Imagine that, imagine that) (Imagine
that, imagine, imagine that)
Strawberries and whipped cream, imagine that (Imagine that, imagine that)
(Imagine that, imagine, imagine that) Ooh baby, candles and oils surroundin'
the bed (Imagine that, imagine that) (Imagine that, imagine, imagine that)
Imagine, Im takin' off my clothes, baby (Imagine that) Hey, do it, baby, take
off all your clothes, baby (Imagine that) Hey, 'cause you owe me, baby And I
want you, baby, so let it take control (Imagine that)
Hey, baby, let it take control, ohh (Imagine that) Imagine that Im kissin' you
(Imagine that) From feet to head, it's you and me in the bed
Scream it, baby (Imagine that) Say my name, say my name Say my name, say my
name (Imagine that) Say my name, oww
