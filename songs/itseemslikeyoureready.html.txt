Temperatures rising, <br>
And Your body's yearnin' for me. <br>
Girl, lay it on me, <br>
I place no one above thee, <br>
Oh, take me to your ecstasy. <br>
<br>
It seems like you're ready (seems like you're ready). <br>
Girl are you ready, <br>
To go all the way? <br>
It seems like you're ready (seems like you're ready). <br>
Girl, are you ready, <br>
To go all the way? <br>
<br>
I can smell your perfume, <br>
Step into my bedroom, <br>
Let me love you constantly. <br>
Oh,oh, your body is my playground, <br>
Let me lick you up and down, <br>
Make you feel like a woman should. <br>
<br>
It seems like you're ready (seems like you're ready). <br>
Girl, are you ready, <br>
To go all the way? <br>
It seems like you're ready (seems like you're ready). <br>
Girl, are you ready, <br>
To go all the way?
