Theres no such thing as pain when Im with you
And it will never rain as long Im around youuuu
My struggles dont exist since I met youuu youuu
Dont have to search nomore since my eyes found  Youuu

Im honored to be lying here next to you watering  seeds and watching them grow
with you

OOO girl this lovemaking bond between us two Has captivated my whole
understanding Boo its so  unreal to good to be true how I feel when Im inside
of you something like a miracle but All so spritual  Staring in your eyes while
your juices flow
Youre so beautiful Ohh you make my life so  beautiful Girl in my eyes you are
my butterfly  Girl you spread your wings just like a butterfly And then you
take flight just like a butterfly  Bouncing through the wind just like a
butterfly And then you landed on me like a butterfly  Girl you warm my heart
like a butterfly  And you swoop through my garden like butterfly Soak up the
sun just like a butterfly  And then you landed on meeeeeeeeeeee Im so glad you
