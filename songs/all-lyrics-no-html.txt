And something just didn't sound right
And so I'm calling you back to check on you
How you holding up?

[R. Kelly:]
Oh everything is fine

[Kelly Price:]
You know I don't believe you

[Kelly Price:]
I'm not saying it, but I know you

[R. Kelly:]

[Kelly Price:]
Cause you're my brother
And therefore I can tell
When something is troubling you

[R. Kelly:]
Ok Ok, I give you that
Nothing's wrong, I take that back
There is something on my mind
But sis, I don't want to waste your time

[Kelly Price:]
But I done told you time and time again
Whatever you're going through
You can come and talk to me
And I will say a prayer with you

[R. Kelly:]
But I done prayed and prayed night and day
I still can't seem to find my way

[Kelly Price:]
Rob that ain't nothing but the devil telling you
That you're washed up and you're through
But sister's here to let you know
Boy you're gonna make it through

[R. Kelly:]
Sister, do you really believe that I can rise again

[Kelly Price:]
Yes, and not only that, Rob, God will forgive you for your sins

[R. Kelly:]
Can you tell me what to do?

[Kelly Price:]
Well first you gotta believe the truth

[R. Kelly:]
Sometimes it's hard to believe in Him

[Kelly Price:]
That's okay because he believes in you

The winds, the rain
The storm
The weapons that are formed against us (I will survive)
The trying times
The sleepless nights
Just know that faith is with us (and I believe yeah)
Through all of the hills
And valleys roamed
That we must come to (woah)
Walk side by side
Follow the light
And we'll make it through (We'll make it through yeah)

[R. Kelly:]
So, so what you're saying is believe a little more?

[Kelly Price:]
Yes, cause faith is the key that will opens up the door

[R. Kelly:]
What you're saying to me, it's hard to receive
Especially when trouble follows me

[Kelly Price:]
When we're keeping it real
Robert sometimes
Trouble can follow where you lead

[R. Kelly:]
Yes sister, I know sometimes, but I...

[Kelly Price:]
Just wait, let me make a phone call

[R. Kelly:]
To who?

[Kelly Price:]
A prayer buddy of mine
She can help you tear down your walls

[R. Kelly:]
I don't want nobody in my business

[Kelly Price:]
She's a friend
And besides you need this

[R. Kelly:]
You know how church folk can be

[Kelly Price:]
Boy I'm your sister, trust in me

[R. Kelly:]
Mmm

[Kelly Price:]
Now hold on

[R. Kelly:]
Maybe she's gone...

[Kelly Price:]
No

[R. Kelly:]
Maybe we ought to just try...

[Kim Burrell:]
Ooh what can I do for you?
Hello?

Go ahead Rob, she's talking to you

[R. Kelly:]
Oh, well, I know you must be very busy
So I'm not going to mess around, nah
Just telling my sister how my life is upside down
And I don't know whether I'm going left or right half the time
Sometimes think I'm gonna lose my mind, you feel me?

[Kim Burrell:]
Mmm hmm... similar to what I used to go through

[R. Kelly:]
Really?

[Kim Burrell:]
Yes, and sometimes I still do

[R. Kelly:]
Yeah?

[Kim Burrell:]
See it doesn't matter who you are
Or where you're from
If you struggle, God will use you

[Kelly Price:]
Amen sister, what you're saying is so true
Rob are you there?

[R. Kelly:]
Yes, I'm just listening to the both of you
It's so easy to say, but not so easy to do

[Kim Burrell:]
Yes but if you stand the truth
It will free you

[R. Kelly:]
Oh

[Kim Burrell:]
Just stand strong

[Kelly Price:]
Stand strong

[Kim Burrell:]
With your head held high

[Kelly Price:]
With your head held high

[Kim Burrell:]
Said it wont be long
In time he will provide

[R. Kelly:]
Will he?

[Kelly Price:]
Yes he will

[Kim Burrell:]
You just stay in the race

[Kelly Price:]
Just stay in the race

[Kim Burrell:]
And keep on running

[Kelly Price:]
And down to the end

[Kim and Kelly:]
Cause your day is coming

The winds, the rain
The storm
The weapons that are formed against us
The trying times
The sleepless nights
Just know that faith is with us
Through all of the hills
And valleys roamed
That we must come to
Walk side by side
Follow the light
And we'll make it through

[Kelly Price:]
He'll give you peace
In the midst of your storm

[R. Kelly:]
Sometimes I feel like it's too late for me

[Kelly Price:]
But he'll never leave you

[Kim Burrell:]
No way

[Kelly Price:]
You just gotta hang on

[Kim Burrell:]
Hang on

[Kelly Price:]
Robert say a prayer, keep your head
God will do just what he said

[R. Kelly:]
Finally I think I get it

[Kelly Price:]
Yes, that's it
That's the spirit

The winds, the rain
The storm
The weapons that are formed against us
The trying times
The sleepless nights
Just know that faith is with us
Through all of the hills
And valleys roamed
That we must come to
Walk side by side
Follow the light
And we'll make it through
The winds, the rain
The storm
The weapons that are formed against us
The trying times
The sleepless nights
Just know that faith is with us
Through all of the hills
And valleys roamed
That we must come to
Walk side by side
Follow the light
And we'll make it through
The winds, the rain
The storm
The weapons that are formed against us
The trying times
The sleepless nights
Just know that faith is with us
Baby, we been knowing each other for a long, 
long time for somethin' like this to just go and break up everything. 

[Verse 1:]
Here we are, just sittin' here 
Knowin' we're all alone 
My Rolley's lookin' at me 
Sayin' it's time to get it on 
You know what I want 
And baby, I know what you need 
So stop hesitatin', girl 
And give your love to me. 

[Chorus:]
All I really want is to love you, babe 
Make your body feel like heaven, babe

Though the fireplace is burnin' marshmallows just right 
To who it may concern

Body parts that he DON'T kiss 
Girl, I will kiss for you 
Just put this CD on the repeat 
And let me pamper you. 

[Repeat Chorus]

Now the swimmin' pool's out back 
Come on and skinny dip, baby 
Eat breakfast in the morning

In the middle of the night 
There's no need for morning here 
So hold your pillow tight 
Cuz I wanna do it again and again.

Still we won't have enough 
Take this love to you

Baby, lets asure 
I just wanna set you free, free. 

[Repeat Chorus til fade]
As I look into my life 
Searching for that paradise

Oh Lord will you help me, find me
Take this crazy ghetto past of mine
And put it all behind me
Look down on the ghetto man
And change his mission
And put it in the hearts
Of many to stop confusion

[Chorus]
My sistas, brothas
Let's put these hands together
We need to stop chokin' on the truth
And start smokin' on a plan man
Love and respect that woman
And bring her happiness
I'm talkin' to the ghetto
For each other we should help
While our babies are dying in the street
We've got to be saying to ourselves
My time, my patience, my love
My blood, my sweat, my tears
My burdens, my drama, my pain
My car, my money, my home
My ups, my downs, my fears
And my hours, my work, my strength
My fault, my this, my that
Nigga please

If you don't stop
(This is a warning)
Someone's gonna lay in your bed

And someone's gonna eat your food

And someone's gonna fit your shoes
(This is a warning)
And someone's gonna get your keys

And someone's gonna open your doors
(This is a warning)
Someone's gonna get your check
(This is a warning)
This is a woman's threat
Baby, this is a woman's threat

My shakin', my sleep, my stress
My days, my night, my rest
My do's, my don'ts, my dares
And my church, my pastor, my prayers
My all, my faith, my powers
And my kitchen, my sink, my towels
My joy, my sad, my hate
And my sister, my cousin, my friends
My lights, my gas, my bills
My role, my way, my will
My hollerin', my fussin', my fights
Nigga please

If you don't stop
(This is a warning)
Someone's gonna lay in your bed
(This is a warning)
And someone's gonna eat your food

And someone's gonna open your doors
(This is a warning)
Someone's gonna get your check
(This is a warning)
This is a woman's threat
Baby

My future, my hopes, my dreams
My panties, my socks, my things
My flowers, my dress, my ring
My man, my lover, my king
My live, my chance, my fault
And my guts, my courage, my wounds
My fence, my neighbors, my yard
My chains, my lock, my guards
My win, my lose, my gain
And my credit, my card, my name
Myself, my freedom, my roof
Nigga please

If you don't stop

Listen
(Whoa, whoa...)
Have you ever heard the story
About the three little bears
See they papa was gone
For a long, long, long, long time
When he returned
To his sweet little home
He had come to find
That all of his porridge was gone

If you don't stop

Someone's gonna lay in your bed
(This is a warning)
And someone's gonna eat your food

And I thank you for every blessing that you givin me lord
And im grateful for all my talent and my vocal accords 
And all these hatas I keep shakin em off
Rubbin they face in fame

Over the years
You see me on tv sometimes
Not how it is
Yall gotta start learnin how to separate me from showbiz 
When im rollin through your city
Show me love
And ladies when you see a boy
Give me love
And though im not conceited (right)
Its jus my space sometimes I need it (right)
Said I got so many friends in them area codes
That I hand out them tickets when it comes to my shows
Ja lets break bread together
Pray together
That we grow strong together
Its clear forever
Help each other through the stormy weather
Lets hurt together
Lets cry together
And even if we grow together
Then together we'll make it better

Mmmmm.. ohhhh, ohhhohhhhh
Oooohhh.. ohhh no, mmmmm

[Chorus: R. Kelly + (Jay-Z)*]
You and me, havin sex
After an argument, that shit's the best
You and me, havin sex yeahh
After an argument, that shit's the best
(Think about it while the streets you roam
 It's Dom P and Army in the fridge when you get home)

[*overlapping R's last line]

I storm in, she storm out
It's like the "War of the Roses" goin on in my house
It's a little seperation but I know how to fix the situation
Mami just sufferin from love deprevation
So I gotta give her thug reperations
Put it in the life until love leg is shakin
Slow and passionate, 'til we forget what happens
Then we laughin and we back friends

[Interlude: R. Kelly]
You don't have to fuss and fight
Why don't you just spend the night
Baby let's just kiss and hug
You know the words girl let's make up
So much love to be made
Instead of screamin, "Who's to blame?"
Girl I don't wanna.. let you go, I need you so

[Chorus]

[Jay-Z]
Girlfriend didn't believe me when I said I'd be back in a little
Cause I had the Chris T on with the crease in the middle
Plus a fresh cut and the freezin icicles
on my wrist, on my hand, that's when shit hit the fan
Said, "You never spend timey, what's up with that?"
Translated it means
[R] Hit it hard from the back
Yeah she hid my car keys
And forced me to fall asleep to her heartbeat

[Interlude]

[Chorus w/o Jay-Z]

[R. Kelly]
I don't want.. baby I don't want to fight
I just wanna make it right (ooh yeah)
Put out problems to the side
Let's just make sweet love tonight (I don't want)
Baby I don't want to fight
I just wanna make it right (ohhhhh love)
Put our problems to the side
Let's just make sweet love tonight

[Jay-Z]
Sex so intense, all that's on my mind
It ain't feel this good since the very first time
I'm pullin her close, she's pullin away
I'm tryin to kiss her mouth but she keeps turnin her face
Cute sex game like our very first date
We ain't know each other well enough, we had to wait
But oh!  I know just where your hot spot at
You can not deny that, so do not try that
I do not buy that..

[Chorus w/o Jay-Z]

[Chorus w/o Jay-Z (fades out)]
My mind is telling me no but my body my body's telling me yes
I (baby) don't want to hurt nobody
But there is something that I must confess........... (chill)

[Chorus: repeat 4x]
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind

See I know just what you want and I know just what you need girl
So baby bring your body to me (bring your body here)
I'm not fooling around with you baby
My love is true (with you) with you is where I want to be, girl see
you need someone someone like me to satisfy your every needs

[Chorus 4x]

You say he's not treating you right
Then lady spend the night now
I'll love you like you need to be love (girl why don't you try some of me)
No need to look no more because I've opened up my door
You'll never feel another love you see
you need someone, someone like me girl to make love to you baby constantly

[Chorus 4x]
When I discovered you I discovered a piece within, joy like no other,
you're my closest friend,
if you were a number you'd be a perfect 10
right out of the skies you were heaven sent.
the way we make love over and over again
if I had to describe you I wouldn't know where to begin
I am so proud to be your next of kin
you prayed over me when I had no reason to live

[Chorus:]
candy caramel coated taffies chocolate covered strawberries,
love so sweet, your my chocolate factory
gum drops mixed with chocolate milk bars, theres so much variety
love so sweet, your my chocolate factory

now if I could write a book on how you make me feel
the tittle would be strong black man, and that's for real
you got me going round and round like a ferries wheel
in and out of relationships and baby your the deal,
ain't nobody on god's green earth for me, heaven stirred us up together
and made the perfect chemistry, wouldn't change you for the world as long as I exist.
Always in the kitchen cooking my favorite meal.

[Chorus x3]
Entrea
Ay, tantas cosas que quiero
Decirte yo quiero 
Hacer por ti
But first we must dancce

Private cotillion style
One lady's fantasy 
Trip to Milan tonight 
Exclusive shopping spree
Mansions await, your scent 
That smells just like treasure 
Dining with me in suites
That overlooks the shore

[1] - As we move, then we touch, then we dip
(Dancin' with a rich man)
As we move, then we touch, then we dip
(Shall we dance, shall we dance, shall we dance)
As we turn, then we stare, then we kiss
(Dancin' with a rich man)
As we turn, then we stare, then we kiss

Kissing the feet of you
While listening to Bonsois
And your angelic brace
Wearing Victoria 
Passionate love with you 
Hearing you "Oh, oui oui" 
Some antique jewelry from
Kenshire's gallery 

[Repeat 1]

And when you elevate
Like visions of grandeur
Mademoiselle and me
Behind the villa doors
Sunsets on yellow sand 
That's where we rendezvous
Chapels of Valentine
Is just to name a few

[Repeat 1]
[1] - Did you ever think that you would be this rich
Did you ever think that you would have these hits
Did you ever think that you would be the don
Have a crib with a fifty acre lawn

Did you ever think that you would be this paid
Were there times when your ass was real afraid
Did you ever think that you would sell out tours
Have a show with fifty million viewers

I used to think about how I was gonna make it
Struggling day to day just trying to get this paper
Hoping the day would come when things would go my way
But now I'm living lavish and all I do is hear them say

[Repeat 1]

Now I've been around the world and seen so many things
Partied in every club nothing but VIP
I never take for granted these luxuries I have
Just try my best to answer all of these questions that I ask

[Repeat 1]
[Repeat 1]

I used to play the game, at night the same old same
Dreamin' about city lights it was my only lie
And now it's world wide shows
As if I can fly on over 
Now I can't go nowhere without the whole world due to know

[Repeat 1]

I used to dream about this life
Now I'm sitting on first class flights
Now they all wanna know

Na-na so sick, make your toes twitch
Get up in yo' ass and ride that shit
Oh yeah, dare you act shady with the first lady?
Let's go half on this baby
Inner thighs thick so when we fuck you must put me in a Swiss ho'
Room 704, fuck they mad at me fo'?
Skin copper, na-na stay proper, who could stop her?
Nuthin'. Hey, do a somersault
All that platinum shit you bought?
Nigga, fuck you thought, it ain't my fault
Keep the wrist rocky, attitude cocky
Next time you see me, address me like "Miss Foxy"
It's for the wrist cop it, if it's a six drop it
Thongs with topless how you like that Robbie?
Ain't nothing sweet, you know my style, doggy style
From the back, in the back, hit it like that

[R]
[1] - The dollar bill
[Foxy]

In two hours first class still time to take a shower

Where ever we be it's VIP stats, no doubt

Say lady, I'm liking what I see 
Come on and talk to me baby, baby, baby

We'll go somewhere and be 
Talkin' about your future plans with me

[Sparkle & Cynthia]
I would do anything 
To have you in my life, that's right
We can take a flight out of here go anywhere

[R]
Uh uh, I got proof rims on the V-12 
Make you raise the roof, no gold in the tooth
Put some in the vault CD's overseas
Private lofts, I'm you haters holocaust
Ain't my fault I rap, then still made a mill'
But it's my fault I got my own label deal
Vacation in Japan while you wish for Bennihana's
On the way to pick up Madona, the ill na-na

[Foxy]
Now you know the na-na plays with the big boys, aye'day 
From the six coupe to the big Royce, can you handle that?
A lotta sass and ass with that 
And I'm strickly for the dough
So fuck you think I'm here fo'?
Princesses in a row, row platinum status 
Ice lace to pink face
Then I back the faggots
See me rocking aye'thang from Mongolians to Persians 
Y'all still learning, I got ¡Rem swervin', through a sermon
And there's nuthin' you can tell me 'bout these cats that I
Don't even ram through a plan, too much stack 
Must I continue this?
Might be a couple of cats that I miss
We could skip the french kiss, take it straight to the wrist 
And it gets no iller than this
Na-na engraved on canary ice, see me wear it twice
Did y'all niggas hear me right?
Me and Kelly put the lock down on New York to Chitown 
His town to my town, for the dollar bill

[Repeat 1]

[Tone]
Tell me who dat said dat we couldn't rock
I roll the dice, bet the dots say we won't stop
I roll from Chitown to Cali, hit your block
I bless the day that R&B music meet hip hop
You haters thought that Kelly couldn't keep it hot
Even when I'm in your face, y'all see me not
Sportin' nothing but the rocks, navigators on the block
Merridian CD's with five TV's
College honeys follow in your GS3
We on the way to IHOP, coming from the spot
Niggas in the lot jammin' to the knock
Y'all mad cuz you can't get what we got
Who's the number one contender, January through December?
Cut your forest down while you niggas screamin' Timothy
Sophia know me from the beach house in Miami
Banks know me, so I could give a damn about the Grammies

For you cuz you were wit me
Something let me thinking that whatever happens

Cuz I'm gonna be about both of us
I won't talk about makin' sweet love
Cuz I'm gonna be about makin' sweet love

Now I remember when we used the crib in Studio 12A
Clothes and pallets on the floor makin' sweet love night till day
Used to say I wanna have a baby boy and call him Man
But now it's all gone up in smoke and baby I don't understand
All I know that is I was wrong

Damn I was wrong (I was wrong)

[Fade]
Listen girl you want me but he needs you
Yet you're tellin' me that everything is cool
Tryin' to convince me baby to do as you say
Just go along and see things your way

[1] - And keep it on the down low 
Nobody has to know
We can keep it on the down low
Nobody has to know

Secret lovers is what you wanna be
While making love to him girl you're silently calling on me
What is a man to do in a situation like this?
I feel there is something that I don't wanna miss

[Repeat 1]
[Repeat 1]

Beautiful you are but you're his by far
Comin' by my way drivin' his fancy car
Making plans to be in my life forever
Tell me, tell me that we'll always be together

[Repeat 1]
[Repeat 1]

Listen babe I won't whisper a word
Down low double life
1, 2 equals us, she, she and me, I fell in loves
How could something so right go so wrong
Just coming in on flight 412
But she was listening on the phone
I thought I had it all together
But I was wrong obviously
Cuz what was once done in the dark
Came to light eventually

[1] - Living down low, down low
Living that double life
Living down low, down low
Living that double life
It ain't right

I don't believe the shit I did the night we were at your mom's
I got a page from out of town, lied and said it was my job
Grabbed my hat, coat, gloves and scarf
I told you that I would return
But by the look upon your face you had already discerned
You pulled me to the side and you begged for me to stay
But I was caught up in a life that forced me to walk away

[Repeat 1]

Okay you, you're saying you came in and
And these two women they, they poured
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, it wasn't nothing like that
All I know is uh, I was asleep, they came in
Woke me up pourin' hot grits
And all kinds of shit on me man, okay beatin' me and shit
Hittin' me with all sorts of type shit (Damn)

With a cigar in my mouth over Vegas city lights
On a path way up the hill to be with my other wife
A rich nigga living strife going on like nothing's wrong
But that damn Caller ID is the reason for this song
So one called up the other while I was out playing some golf
Talking about my doggish ways and how I need to be droppped off

[Repeat 1]

Now go ahead, shoot me now because I'm guilty as sin
Playin' Russian roulette with hearts not to mention the kids
Now every day I live I regret all that I did
Out smoking with friends as I reminisced

[Repeat 1]

I can't take it no more I've got to confess
See now, I don't know why
I thought that I could keep creeping
Cuz you see what goes around
Comes back on around and back on around
And back on around again, yes it does
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
In a state of shock that's what it left me
Take it from a man who knows
That three ain't company
No, no, no that's what I kept telling myself
Now I done lost the houses the kids and the dogs
Now I'm sleeping in my momma's house
And even she says, your sorry ass don't deserve no help
Must be because of what my old man did to her
Niggas
Rockland
So amazing, unbelievacle, miraculous women you are.
Incredible, unforgetable, your the worlds greatest by far.
Sensational, so lovable, my cinderella you are.
So beautiful, ghetto fablous, the reason i wish upon a star.
As i lay me down to sleep i, pray your heart ill always keep it.
Hope you feel the same.
So baby come and hop on board my life and,
Just let love take us away.

[chorus:]
Dream girl lets take a flight,
Far away to a paradise.
Dream girl lets take a ride,
Destination rainbow skys.
Dream girl lets kiss and hug,
On a beach with white sand and all white doves.
Dream girl lets cuddle up.
Somewhere, where ever and make sweet love.

Baby you are my dream, dream, dream, dream girl
My sunshine, my blueskys, love is who you are to me girl,
My angel, my piece of mind, woman you have come to set me free.
Love makin, breath takin, sweet valentines to me.
Heart racin, creatin, and incredible fire within me.
I believe in you and me, together for all eternity.
And i hope you feel the same
So baby come and hope on board my life and, let love take us away.

[chorus]

Baby this love we make is to good to be true,
Heaven must really love me because heaven sent me you.
Keep bringing me joy, i dont wanna wake up.
I stay asleep as long as i can have you right here in my dreams.

[chorus x3]
Baby, I'm so glad you're over here
Now I get to show you all the things
That I been wanting to show you for such a long time
Don't say nuthin'

Picture this you and me in the kitchen babe, on the counter
Feeding each other fruits babe
Straight from there walk into the bedroom babe
I touch your hair and then you turn around and say what's on your mind
And girl tonight we'll be making sweet love

[1] - Girl tonight we'll make sweet love
Until the rain comes falling down on you and me
All of these things and etcetera etcetera etcetera
Wanna kiss you places you want me to
Promise girl that I'll do all of these things
And etcetera etcetera etcetera

Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Doing you pretty much all night long babe
'Till I hear you screaming my name babe
In the pool you and me skinny dippin darlin' Kelly's rules
No playing hard to get now tell me what the deal cuz
Girl tonight we'll be making sweet love

[Repeat 1]

Put on some clothes and lets go to the IHOP, baby

Put your arms around me

Rollers wanna roll
But I'm taking off after I dance, yeah

Put your hands up

Playas wanna play
Ballers wanna ball
Rollers wanna roll

Funny faces is all I see
At my place, you on top of me
Playin' strip poker, sippin' Cristi'
I grip your shoulders, you sqeeze the sheets
I'm admirin' your heart shaped booty
Nothin' in your oven, baby feed me now

Right around the way from me
Watering those ghetto trees
We be high just like them weeds

Might be ghetto but you queen to me 
That's how it's suppose to be
Do whatcha gotta do for me 
Forever fulfill your fantasy
When you think of me, have your cream
Everything my team must to do one thing
You're the meanest queen on the scene
Make a player 'fien and be havin' dreams
For real, it's real as it seems
You bring the trees, I'll bring the B's

Begin to freeze on to me, you can scream to please
Plus I'm ready now, take a stand, got me on Rockland
I can be your freaky man, you can climb in, suck a 10
Want some ends? You outta there
No more funny face, put you in your place
Come be the dinner, I'm a bring a plate

She's my ghetto girl in her own world, she's a queen
Queen of all things, for that I mean she's Spring
Personality rings bells in my dreams
Night to dawn, light spread tight, let's swing
Grip it in motion, wet coastin' with a little bit of ridin' rough
Up and down we stroke, strokin' puttin' things in her pocket is fat
But watch her stay cool, calm and collected
Flexin', check it, never was on that stressin'
Cuz she bring that hay for the day, what a blessin'
Right around the way from me
This ghetto queen got up with a king
Keep it clean and in essence

[Repeat 1]
[Repeat 1]

[Kilo]
Where the players live
Have to deal with the Macks 
Like the traps in the concrete jungle
Life's a safari in the mornin' huntin'
In effect, your pulse beatin' like bongos
We be like this, gettin' high
Ghetto queen you look so delightin'
Heard your body callin', callin' me, baby 
Tellin' me to rodeo ride it
Don't fall off, hold on
Get your roll on, step aside, hugged her back
She swore she wouldn't do me, need your loyalty
You're makin' me wantin' to snap
I know your man is mad as hell
Cuz it to a player and I did it well
And I added one more for the road, to let 'em know
Kilo weigh heavy on the scale, mmm

[Wyldstyle]
Dedicated to my ghetto queens in jeans,
That think they're mean
I'll massage you with whip cream
I wanna spread you legs and said you were my lady
Down with me, clown with me, fall to the ground with me
Lovin' how you sound when we get 'em off
Carry on to the dawn, give a dog a bone (lick 'em low)
Rodeo show, duckin' you, buckin' in the back of a Cadillac
Tell me if you want it like that (let's bang)
Got me tweakin' Mary Jane, it's a hay thang
Me and you, everyday keep it high like flames (your game)
What's my name? What's my name?
It's Wyldstyle from Chitown, no shame
Me and the ghetto queen comin' up the main
Switchin' four lanes, to the airplane
Sky high we fly when we roll by
On the down low, doin' my thang man

Lord forgive me I'm ballin' out of control
Got the spirit of a hustler pouring out of my soul
Mami I love you but ain't no stopping my stroll
If you wanna be down with me you gotta rooolll
Like a roll and if my side of the bed gets cold
You gotta know that I'm out chasin' doooough
I'm ain't stunting these hoes
Stunting my growth if I fuck 'em I'm fleeing them
I need something to hold
Then I'm home to you
I might roam like a cellular phone
But I never leave you alone I
Solemnly swear, I was married to the block before I met you
It's still a part of me there but I
Solemnly swear, I try but it's in my blood
Pumping yay since I was yay high
I'm in love with the life
So except me for the bastard that I am
You're still in love with me right?

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Baby I can't figure it out
Said you pussy tastes like honey
But I can't stop huggin' the block
All night tryna get this money

Stuck between these two worlds
What I'm gonna do with both these girls
Two main squeezes in separate cities
Both found out man, shit ain't pretty
Stuck between these two worlds
What I'm gonna do with both these girls
Hard to choose between her and these streets
Cuz the game keeps calling me

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Baby girl had me off my grind, off my clock
I would often find I was off my block
Couldn't keep her off my mind, my balls were shot
They never thought that a pause or stop
Was in my pores to push rock raw
Take a lost rebound like Bo Outlaw, I'm so outlaw
Got a hunger for this game, but keep that on the low
Like a one against the grain
Got the sun against my brain
A girl in my ear
I like her for her
I'm a dig into this shit, I like it like I like her
Sometimes I can't figure it out
I'm in love with the life but she's sticking it out
She know wanna hug kisses keep a nigga in the house
Lock down while his niggas is out (out)

[Chorus X2]
You made the sun,
You made the moon,
Gave seasons change,
Woah
You made the clouds,
You put the rainbow after rain
Woah
Created time,
Now this ones mine,
Gave pictures frames,
Woah
Created man gave him woman,
Why did you do that for me?

These are the questions asked  before i lay me down and go to sleep, (ooh sometimes i wonder)
Sometimes i wonder why you decided to keep you hands on me.
Of all the miracles, signs and wonders,
There's still one mystery,
How did you manage to love me?

You breathed the life right into me,
Then made my heart beat,
Woah
Created the mountains,
And all of the deep seas,
Flowers in the trees,
Woah
You made tommorrow come again,
You calmed the strong winds,
Woah
And after all I've done,
Gave me a son,
Tell me why would you do that for me?

These are the questions asked  before i lay me down and go to sleep,
(Right in the middle of my prayers)
Sometimes i wonder why you decided to keep you hands on me.
Of all the miracles, signs and wonders,
There's still one mystery,
How did you manage to love me? (how did you manage that?)
How did you manage to love me?

Said I've got to know how (how did you manage to love?)
After all that i have done, oh Lord
How? (how did you manage to love?)
How could i have been so bad, oh Lord
How? (how did you manage to forgive me?)
Even when i didnt believe in me you believed in me Lord.
How? (how did you manage to forgive me?)
Jesus you sacrificed your dear life for me.
(How did you manage to forgive me?)
Ooooh Lord tell me (why did the pain uprise for me)
It's Saturday
I'm ready to go out and have some fun
Get in the club around 'bout twelvish

Lovin' the way the DJ's mixin'
And everybody's on the floor

"Chillin', strokin' the town." [male]
"Sure you don't wanna come over here?"
"Nah, I ain't comin' over there, man."
"What you mean you ain't comin' over here.?"
"'Cause you don't be talkin' about doing shit."
"Who you wit?"
"Don't worry about who I'm wit."
"See, that's why I don't call you."

It's time to be havin' a good time tonight

[Chorus (2x's)]

Help me find a way to that spot tonight
Kelly, won't you help me find a way
I can help you find a way

[Chorus]
I used to think that I could not go on
And life was nothing but an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms

If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

[Chorus:]
I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me, oh

If I can see it, then I can be it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

[Chorus]

Hey, cause I believe in me, oh

If I can see it, then I can be it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

[Chorus]

Hey, if I just spread my wings
I can fly
I can fly
I can fly, hey
If I just spread my wings
I can fly
Fly-eye-eye
I used to think that I could not go on
And life was nothing but an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms

If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

[Chorus:]
I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me, oh

If I can see it, then I can be it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

[Chorus]

Hey, cause I believe in me, oh

If I can see it, then I can be it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

[Chorus]

Hey, if I just spread my wings
I can fly
I can fly
I can fly, hey
If I just spread my wings
I can fly
Fly-eye-eye
Girl I must have been crazy 
To say that it was over
I had to be a fool 
To yell out we were through
And now I'm all alone 
And feeling down and out baby
When I never 
Meant for this to end
It was so so crazy of me
Sometimes we say things that we really don't mean
Well I'm sorry baby
Bring your lovin' back to me

[1] - I can't sleep babe
I can't think babe
I can't live babe
Without you in my life 
I can't go on babe
This is my song baby
Don't wanna do nothin' if I go away baby
And I can't do nothin' if you're not around

Though I must admit 
That things got out of hand
When you told me
That he was just a friend
I should of had my trust in you 
From the very start darlin'
Cuz I never meant for this to end
How can we get it back again?
Oh sometimes a man can say things 
That he really don't mean
Well I'm sorry baby 
Bring your lovin' back to me

[Repeat 1]

Baby can we meet somewhere 
And talk about it
Oh baby, can we work it out
I'm not gonna let you go my baby 
Before I let you know that I

[Repeat 1 until fade]
[Chorus]
I decided to stay home tonite
I decided I'ma treat you right
I decided to be there for you
Decided to be on my P's and Q's
I decided to give up my friends
Decided I'ma take you out weekends
Decided to give you a reason to trust
These are decisions that I make for love

[Verse 1]
Enough is enough no more running around
(Searchin' for what's right here at home)
Because my luck is 'bout to turn around
(And I just can't keep doin' you wrong)
Girl I take it for granted that you will be here always
(Tired of this ego trip)
'Cause soon you'll be searchin' for another man
And I just can't have that happen to me

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]

Now I've had about all that I can stand no more
(I'm turnin' in my playa's card)
See I'm retirin' from the secret life I chose
(Cause I just can't keep breakin' your heart)
It was silly of me to be the way that I was
(First was blind, but now I see)
Baby, soon you'll be sayin' I'm fallin' out of love
And I just can't let it happen whoa whoa I

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

When tha morning comes, you see the sun will shine on you and me
Was on my way to losin' you, until' I found reality
So cast away your doubts and fears, cause from now on I'll be right here
For always
Forever more, I decided

[Chorus & Bridge 2]

Girl I'm going to dump my friends
Yes I will
Truly I will
We are going to be together on the weekend
Whoa, whoa
See these are the decisions I made for love
For the two of us
Get up off this bull and rebuild your trust
Yeah, yeah, oh noooooo, whoa
There will be
No more cheatin'
No more creepin'
No more fuckin'
No more sneakin'
Baby, oh baby
I know we had an argument and all
Ooh babe
And I must have said some pretty foul shit but
Mmm, mmm
I just want you to know that I ain't mean none of that
Baby, baby
None of it

Now I was supposed to be a man about it
Shoulda never left your side
No way, no how
Put too many years in this relationship
And it's not that serious for us to split
Now I admit sometimes I make mistakes
But still I appreciate the love we make
Stop at the door and put your bags back down
Now baby please can we work this out

Now I might say you can walk
(But I don't mean it)
And I might name call
(I don't mean it)
I may pull some silly stunts
(Uhm mmm)
But that's just a front, I don't mean it
(Now wait a minute hear me out)
Now I may holler at you
(I don't mean it)
And I may tell you we're through
(But I don't mean it, no, no)
May give you looks that can kill
(Can kill)
But it's not for real
(Not for real)
I don't mean it
(I don't mean it hey)

Now I was supposed to be more understanding
Instead of tryin to be so damn demandin
Baby I'm willing to drop my ego
And do the things I should have done and more
See I know that I can be a better man
Girl all you gotta do is take my hand
Promise me this time
I'm goin all the way
And show you all the reasons why you stayed

Now I might say you can walk
(But I don't mean it, no, no)
And I might name call
(Girl I don't mean it)
I may pull some silly stunts
(Ooh yeah)
But that's just a front, I don't mean it
(Listen baby)
Now I may holler at you
(But I don't mean it)
And I may tell you we're through
(Girl you should know, I don't mean it)
May give you looks that can kill
(Um mmm)
But it's not for real
I don't mean it
(Come here girl)

See I never meant
To break you down
And make you cry, make you cry
Oh please baby please
Turn back around
Don't you say goodbye, say goodbye
Sometimes I know that
I can take it
Just a little bit too far
But yo my heart is good
Heart is good
So baby you don't have to worry
You're gonna see a change
Girl you know I love ya
Even though I may say

Now I might say you can walk

And I might name call
(But I don't mean it)

And I might name call

I mean everybody say "What if." What if I could fly? What if man could fly for real? Wouldn't that be something? Man I
would surely touch the sky if I could just fly. [laughs] You know we have our dreams, we always say what if, what if this,

Signs and wonders that the television shows
Hate and poverty for the more, lets me know
That life is a stage and we're all in the show
Starring the World, cause we all blow

(Heaven I'm calling, heaven I'm calling)
If we just give each other a chance

We might just fall in love

Picture us (in a land)
Where there's no more (no more war)
Shaking hands with my (brother)
And respecting my my my (my sisters)
(I'm offering) a dance that heals
(A melody) you can feel
Love is the key
All it takes is you and me

But take away In God We Trust
Tell me what the hell is wrong with us

Marvin Gaye inspired me to write that one ya'll
Just as Frankie Beverley inspired me to write love street
You know every day is a special occasion ya'll
You know why? Cause you woke up this morning
Happy People baby
How did I ever let you slip away
Never knowing I'd be singing this song some day
And now I'm sinking, sinking to rise no more
Ever since you closed the door

[1] - If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then my darlin' you'd still be mine
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then darlin' you, you'd still be mine

Funny, funny how time goes by
And blessings are missed in the wink of an eye
Why oh why oh why should one have to go on suffering
When every day I pray please come back to me

[Repeat 1]

And you had enough love for the both of us
But I, I, I did you wrong, I admit I did
But now I'm facing the rest of my life alone, whoa

[Repeat 1]

I'd never hurt you (If I could turn back)
Never do you wrong (If I could turn back)
And never leave your side (If I could turn back)
If I could turn back the hands

There'd be nothing I wouldn't do for you 
(If I could turn back)
Forever honest and true to you
(If I could turn back)
If you accept me back in your heart, I love you
(If I could turn back the hands)

(If I could turn back)
That would be my will
(If I could turn back)
Darlin' I'm begging you to take me by the hands
(If I could turn back the hands)

I'm going down, yes I am 
(If I could turn back)
Down on my bended knee, yeah
(If I could turn back)
And I'm gonna be right there until you return to me
(If I could turn back the hands)

(If I could turn back)
If I could just turn back that little clock on the wall
(If I could turn back)
Then I'd come to realize how much I love you 
Love you love you love you
(If I could turn back the hands)
I don't understand
I do all this for you
You contemplating on me
Or is it him 
Or is it me
Or is it him
He told you he'd be there for you 
And he wasn't
I told you I'd be there for you
And I was
And still is the real is 
Who takes care of biz
Took you from apartments
And got you home like The Wiz
I'm not the kind of guy 
To give you everything
But if you're real then
You can get some ice in your rings
You and me straight to the crib
Off the tour bus
Spottin' my eyes, fireplace, big as us
It really don't matter
Who's first in the shower
Fruit platter from a young maid every hour
And when it comes down to the dollar
You can have it
All ya gotta do is keep it hoppin' like a rabbit
Friends come around don't be ready to change
Treat me like a stepchild when I';m up on my game
Remember I'm the first to give your cootie the pain
So I wanna hear you answer when I ask you my name

Ooh baby, I want you here with me
And give you everything 
That your heart desires
Lady can you feel me 
Do you wanna be with me for always
Baby can't you see 
What you do to me
when he do the things that he has done to you baby

[1] - You don't need nobody to love you
You don't need nobody to kiss you
You don't need nobody to please you, ooh babe
Cuz I can do those things if I'm wit you, baby

Now who took you in when that nigga put you out
And who picked you up when that nigga put you down
Restraining orders keep that fool from around
Had to set you up in a spot downtown
See I was the one who was there for you
But I'm not the one that's gonna play the two
Channel bags in the trunk what you gon' do
You could treat the future like a menu
As long as I'm the only one to bend you
And when you wanna take a flight I'm the one to send you
Never be the one that's out to hurt you
Tell you that I'm there and then desert you

[Repeat 1]
[Repeat 1]

Baby, can't you see
What you do to me
When he do the things he do to you, baby

[Repeat 1 until fade]
You remind me of somethin'
I just can't think of what it is

Girl, please let me stick my key in your ignition,
babe
So I can get this thing started and get rollin', babe
See, I'll be doin' about 80 on your freeway
Girl, I won't stop until I drive you crazy

So buckle up 'cause this can get bumpy, babe
Now hit the lights and check out all my functions,
babe
Girl, back that thing up so I can wax it, baby
Honey, we gon' mess around and get a ticket, babe

'Cause we off up in this jeep
We foggin' up the windows
We got the radio up
We all up in the back
We got the shit bouncin'
We goin' up and down
And we smokin' and we drinkin'
Just thuggin' it out

Jump up, down once I hit them switches, babe

Close your eyes
Now relax your mind
Now I want you to picture yourself far far away
(Prepare yourself girl cause we bout to take a ride)
And I don’t want you to have a care in the world right now
It’s just you and me
In this moment… quiet
Listen

Baby take your mind into a zone 
Imagine that we all alone
Two ways are off and our friends are gone
Now it’s just you and me getting it on
Take my hand and come with me
Let’s indulge in fantasies
Cast your cares and worries
While we fall into this ecstasy

I’m gonna rub your body, so baby just relax
You’ve been pouring out your loving, so now its time to pour it back
Imagine that
Image that imagine that imagine that imagine that imagine imagine that
Me stroking your body
Image that imagine that imagine that imagine that imagine imagine that
Whip cream and strawberries know what I mean
Image that imagine that imagine that imagine that imagine imagine that
Candles and oils surrounding the bed
Image that imagine that imagine that imagine that imagine imagine that
Me kissing your body from feet to head

Imagine that
We don’t have to talk
Lay your body here and watch my fingers walk
Take a second and imagine the opportunity
You and me sharing sexual energy
Now girl just mediate on you being in this chair
Then close your eyes and act like we not even here
Girl

I’m gonna rub your body, so baby just relax
You’ve been pouring out your loving, so now its time to pour it back
Imagine that
Image that imagine that imagine that imagine that imagine imagine that

[Intro]
Yeah, like I was saying
I ain't, ya know what
I'm not tryin' to say things to hurt you
You know what I'm saying
I don't wanna hurt you, baby
Just sometimes you do things 
That push me to say things I don't wanna say
You know what I'm saying?
You know I love you
You know I care about you
This time, you just brought it on yourself
Yo, check it out

Now I shoulda been more man
About the way things went down
Especially since we been dealin' 
For like seven years now
I've been slowly, slowly bringing you down
No conversation, no good sex in a while
But still you search and find a way
To love me somehow
Even though I ride, you still trust me somehow
Got my faces, some ice and a tie
Slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly goin' down

(I don't mean it) When I hollar at you 
(I don't mean it) When I say that we're through 
(I don't mean it) What I'm takin' you through 
(I don't mean it) Baby 
(I don't mean it) Said I'm sorry 
(I don't mean it) Can you find a way to forgive me
(I don't mean it) Said I went to church this morning 
(I don't mean it) I don't mean it

Running around here talking about 
How I'm a big player now
Hidden in corners, blinging out our share
Kelly makin' hits now
Thinking about this industry 
And how I put it out
You were there for me 
When I used dish rags for ties
There's times that I didn't hear you
I was talkin' too loud
When I didn't come home
I was hanging with the crowd
Whenever we fight I try to win every round
Can you find a way to forgive me now

(I don't mean it) Cuz I don't mean it
(I don't mean it) When I hollar at you
(I don't mean it) Whenever I say we're through
(I don't mean it) Whoa
(I don't mean it) Can you find a way to forgive
(I don't mean it) Ooh baby, I
(I don't mean it) I went to church this mornin'
(I don't mean it) Ooh I don't mean it

[R.] Father, can you help me?
[Priest]What do you need from me?
[R.] I broke up with my girl and I'm feelin' kinda lonely
[Priest]I been watching you from Heaven, Kelly
You been so demanding
You need to read my word, son
And get some understanding
[R.] But I been busy with my music
[Priest]Stop making excuses
Recognize the love she gives
And try not to abuse it
[R.] Is it too late to get her back?
[Priest]Not as long as I'm a fact
[R.] Well father, show me a sign
That will make her mine

(I don't mean it) I don't mean it
(I don't mean it) Whenever I say we're through
(I don't mean it) Or whenever I hollar at you
(I don't mean it) Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
(I don't mean it) Ooh baby, ooh baby
(I don't mean it) See what was straight is now stone
(I don't mean it) Because I took you for granted, oh
(I don't mean it) Whoa
(I don't mean it) Whoa you should know I don't mean it
(I don't mean it) I put it on my life
(I don't mean it) Believe me I pay the price
(I don't mean it) When I was down and out
(I don't mean it) You reached out your hand
(I don't mean it) I've learned it takes a good woman
(I don't mean it) To raise a man
(I don't mean it) Oh, I love you baby
(I don't mean it) Oh oh oh I love you baby
[Celine]
No mountain's too high for you to climb
All you have to do is have some climbing faith, oh yeah
No river's too wide for you to make it across
All you have to do is believe it when you pray

[R. Kelly]
And then you will see the morning will come
And every day will be bright as the sun
All of your fears cast them on me
I just want you to see

[Both]
[1] - I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I hear your voices when you call me
I am your angel

And when all hope is gone, I'm here
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your angel
I'm your angel

[R. Kelly]
I saw your teardrops and I heard you cry
All you need is time
Seek me and you shall find
You have everything and you're still lonely
It don't have to be this way
Let me show you a better day

[Celine]
And then you will see the morning will come
And all of your days will be bright as the sun
So all of your fears just cast them on me
How can I make you see?

[Repeat 1]

[R ] And when it's time to face the storm
[Celine] I'll be right by your side
[R ] Grace will keep us safe and warm
[Celine] And I know we will survive
And when it seems as if your end is drawing near
[R ] (The end is drawing near)
[Celine] Don't you dare give up the fight 
[R ] (Oh no)
[Celine] Just put your trust beyond the skies

[Repeat 1 until fade]
Yeah I know, y'know, what a calling is
I mean we all have a calling in our life, I believe
You know I'm from the dirt man
I come up in these streets, went without eatin', you know what I'm sayin'?
Saw my Mom go without eatin'
I got tired of that I had to go out there
In them streets and hustle, you know?
I mean you know what I'm sayin'?
I mean it's easy for y'all to say, y'know (I surrender)
Surrender your life, you know what I'm sayin'? (I surrender)
Give your life to God and all that
Y'know, that's good and I believe in God (I surrender to you Lord)
But when you got bills at your front door all the time
You know what I'm sayin'?
Kids screamin' "Daddy, Momma, where the food at?" (I surrender)
Man it makes it kinda hard to believe in (I surrender)
Y'know, and have faith in something that you can't see (I surrender to your Lord)
Even though you wanna believe
Y'all just gonna have to just pray for me
You know what I'm sayin'? 'Cause uh...

Constantly my mind and my heart is racing (yeah)
All by myself trying to solve all these problems I'm facing (oh yeah)
Looking to man trying to find hope (uh-huh)
But man will never know the depth of my struggles (oh)
I was depending on myself (on myself)
To give myself a hand (wow but)
But when depending on myself (I...)
Fell time again (that's why)
And that's why I'm standing here alone (all alone)
With no one else
Lord I realised that I can't fight these battles by myself

I surrender
I surrender (oh I)
I surrender to you Lord
I surrender
I surrender (oh I)
I surrender to you Lord
I surrender (I surrender)
I surrender (Lord to you)
I surrender to you Lord
Coming out with both hands up
I surrender (uhh)

Listen...
I tried everything I could to make it work (mmm-hmm)
But everything I seemed to try just made it worse (ohh)
And every road that I'd go down there were no signs (signs)
Destination lonely with no peace of mind (yeah, ohh)
I was depending on myself (on myself)
To give myself a hand (but when)
But when depending on myself (I would fell time and time again)
Fell time again (that's why)
And that's why I'm standing here alone (standing all alone)
With no one else
Lord I realised that I can't fight these battles by myself
I surrender

I surrender
I surrender (oh I surrender)
I surrender to you Lord (said I surrender)
I surrender (ohh I)
I surrender (surrender)
I surrender to you Lord (I done tried everything and now I)
I surrender (surrender yeah)
I surrender (to you Lord)
I surrender to you Lord
Coming out with both hands up
I surrender (ohh)

Won't you guard the place around it
(There's no where for me to go)
Joy I have tried to find (whoo)
(See I've searched high and I've searched low)
Said you walked throughout the building
So come and rescue me from this hell
'Cause I can't do it by myself (I can't do it... by myself)

I surrender (hey I surrender)
I surrender (ohh) (I surrender)
I surrender to you Lord (I surrender) (I surrender... to you Lord) (yes I do)
I surrender (I surrender) (I surrender) (to you)
I surrender (yeah)
I surrender to you Lord ('cause I'm sick and tired of going through)
I surrender (I need your help) (need your help)
I surrender (to find my may) (to find my way)
I surrender to you Lord (I'm here and willing) (here and willing) (to make a change)
(make a change, yeah)

I surrender to you Lord...
[Jay-Z]
Man, they go and tell me like
you never know who your true friends until you ah umm
both got a little bit of money
I mean cause y'all both broke
then there's no strain on the relationship, y'all both broke
And if you got money and he ain't got no paper
He still needs you so you'll never know how he really feel about you
When y'all both get some paper, you'll see

[R. Kelly + (Jay-Z)]
We used to get money together, phone honies together
Pushin chromed out twinkies in custom coach leather
You claim it's all love, but nigga it's whatever
Cause this is business, it ain't personal
Same dream, same team, same schemes (mm)
We even sold to the same damn fiends (how real is dat?)
Ain't no rules in this war for this green
This is business, and it ain't personal

[Jay-Z]
Look, I'm a grown man dog
And I ain't got time to be runnin behind y'all
I know when I first started it was crazy to y'all
"He's gon' start his own label, he'll never be able"
Well, nigga you've been wrong before
And you'll be wrong again if you bet against him
We move through the hood like identical twins
But it just so happen that a nigga made it rappin
You showed your true colors, y'all niggaz stay yappin
That don't stop him, a nigga weigh platinum
Stop through the hood, to say what's happenin? (sup nigga)
Fake hugz (uh-huh) fake whassup
Fake love, fake fuck, fake thugs
Gotta one myself for your fake shit, I raise up
Hop in my wheels and I peel, streets are blazed up (uh-huh)
About my bid'ness dog, y'all need to stay up - one

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
We used to get money together, phone honies together
Pushin chromed out twinkies in custom coach leather
You claim it's all love, but nigga it's whatever
Cause this is business, it ain't personal
Same dream, same team, same schemes
We even sold to the same damn fiends
Ain't no rules in this war for this green
This is business, and it ain't personal

[R. Kelly]
I wish, I wish - that success, we could all
get a piece of it (word) but that ain't real dog (no)
Cause in these streets it's war, the industry much more
But rich or poor, I'ma keep it real my nigga
Invest in chips and watch my money hill get bigger
And do things like, pull up to some clubs
in the skirts with Jigga, and yellin out HEY!
What the fuck, pop that Cris' my nigga
And then he wants to know how many chips I done sold
Well it ain't y'all business what's behind my doors
But y'all niggaz don't appreciate shit
Helped you out and you still actin like a little bitch
Then you wonder why I put yo' ass in the tenth row
when you asked me for some tickets to my TP-2 show
Lawwwwwwd tell me, why we don't like to see us grow

[Chorus + ad libs]

[Jay-Z]
A-Alike (uh-huh) be alike (that's right)
We don't vibe no more because we don't C/see alike
And your mom got it twisted, she think Hov' changed
Nope; Hov's still here like Rogaine
Ask your boy what he did to the Hov' game
How he jeapordized the whole game
Now when we see each other it's so strange
I don't know whether to hug him or slug him (damn)
I don't know whether to cap him or dap him
I don't know what to think of him, I don't know what's happenin
But what I do know, all the niggaz that you know
locked up doin a few doe, but who knows?
Maybe it wasn't you, maybe I'm buggin too (right)
But I'm scared dog, I don't know what the fuck to do
Do me a favor, place yourself in my shoes
The game, no exceptions, gotta follow the rules

[Chorus]
Temperatures rising, 
And Your body's yearnin' for me. 
Girl, lay it on me, 
I place no one above thee, 
Oh, take me to your ecstasy. 

It seems like you're ready (seems like you're ready). 
Girl are you ready, 
To go all the way? 
It seems like you're ready (seems like you're ready). 
Girl, are you ready, 
To go all the way? 

I can smell your perfume, 
Step into my bedroom, 
Let me love you constantly. 
Oh,oh, your body is my playground, 
Let me lick you up and down, 
Make you feel like a woman should. 

It seems like you're ready (seems like you're ready). 
Girl, are you ready, 
To go all the way? 
It seems like you're ready (seems like you're ready). 
Girl, are you ready, 
To go all the way?

I wish, I wish, I wish
To every city
I wish, I wish, I wish
Every hood
I wish, I wish, I wish
And every block
I wish, I wish, I wish
Ghetto America!

Rollin' through the hood
Just stopped by to say what's up
And let you know
That your baby boy ain't doing so tough
And even though you passed
Going on four long years
Still waking up late at night crying tears
Just thinking about those days
You used to talk to me
Smilin' while I'm sippin' on this Hennesy
And remember we bragged on how rich we would be
To get up out this hood was like a fantasy

[1]
And now you hear my songs the radio is playin'
Oh I can't believe my ears
And what everybody's sayin'
And boy I'll tell you
Folks don't know the half
I would give it all up
Just to take one ride

(With you)
How I used to kick it on the front porch
(With you)
And how I used to lay back and smoke weed
(With you)
And all the little basement party joints we'd do
Now I'm just missing you
How I wish

[2]
I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smiling down on me
Saying everything's okay
And if I make it out this thug life
I'll see you again someday
I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish

Now ever since this money come
Been nothing but stress
Sometimes I wish I could trade in my success
Y'all look at me and say boy you've been blessed
But y'all don't see the inside of my unhappiness
Man I swear this shit gets heavy like a ton
That's why you hear me shootin'
This real shit off like a gun
Hmm I wonder how my friends would treat me now
If I wasn't iced up with a Bentley and a house
That's why fake ass niggas get fake ass digits
And fake ass players get a real player hatin' 'em
Honey Love goes platinum and y'all ass come around
But y'all don't wanna raise the roof
Until my shit is going down

[Repeat 1]

(With you)
How I used to hoop off in them tournaments
(With you)
And how I used to club hop on weekends
(With you)
Your family called the morning of the tragic end
Damn, my condolensces

[Repeat 2]

Voices in my head be telling me to come to church
Saying the Lord is the only way for you to stop the hurt
Dreaming of windows black tinted like a hearse
When waking up to life sometimes seems worst
And all I ever wanted is to be a better man
And I try to keep it real with my homies land
For me to save the world I don't understand
How did I become the leader of a billion fans?

[Repeat 1]

(With you)
How I used to street perform on Friday
(With you)
And how I used to go to church on Easter Sunday
(With you)
Instead of you all throwing them stones at me
Somebody pray for me

[Repeat 2 till end]
Yo', what up, my n****
You know I was in the hood
I just thought I'd stop by
Holler at you for a minute
Pour out a little liquor or some'in'

N****, we done been through a lot of s*** together
From runnin' these streets to bein' down for whatever
And now that you're gone I got a whole lot of s*** to
tell you
Things I should've said way back when we was younger

Remember when we used to roll hand in hand
And now I'm trippin' on how I really miss you, man
And remember when you and me would say
We'd get up out this hood and everything would be okay

It's all good now (My n****)
We out the hood now (Mmm)
We had the same ideas, but not the same careers
We shared the same old laugh, and now the same tears

You were my homie, my sconey, my Roni
My n**** and never placed no b**** before me
Man, I sear to God I love for that s***
Why'd you have to get hit
Where was I, what time was it

You were supposed to get older with me
On stage, hands on shoulders with me
Coppin' them Range Rovers with me
Sittin' on thangs and smokin' trees

And if it wasn't for the will that God had made
I'd turn back the hands of time and take your place
Sittin' here sippin' on this Hennessy
Just thinkin' about how much you meant to me (My n***)

Even when you're gone you will always be my n****
When you went home I'm still missin' you, my n****
I'm feelin' like the timing was wrong, my n****
I know you're smilin' down sayin' carry on, my n****

Some times my nights can get long, my n****
Some times I feel God did me wrong, my n****
So I had to write a song, my n****
Just to let you know that you're still my n****

I wish, I wish, I wish (Oh, I)
I wish, I wish, I wish

Little son is lookin' at me like, "Where is my daddy?"
And your 13-year old daughter is mad ¡Rcause she
understands
Promised your mama I'd take care of the family
But she's so hurt, she turns away my helpin' hands

Damn, I wish your a** was here, my n****
To grow that gray beard and smoke that cigar, my n****
And we would talk about you gettin' up out this game
And you would tell me how it keeps callin' your name

(We used to ride-ride-ride)
Never afraid to (Die-die-die)
But some times we (Cry-cry-cry)
Askin' the Lord (Why-why-why)
They're tearin' down these projects

We were homies for like 20 thug years
Sat in church and cried the same thug tears
You remember when Vibe World Premier
How we used to share the same old gear

And remember when you and me would say
We'd get up out this hood and everything would be okay

(It's all good now) My n****
We out the hood now
It's so easy for folks to say, "Rob, just live on"
When I'm dyin' every second that you're gone
Nevertheless I try my best to be strong
Hopin' you said your prayers before you went on home

When we stood on these blocks and just shot the breeze
We'd slapbox dead in the middle of streets
And if a fight broke out, you would take up for me
You're all I have left of these ghetto memories

I wish, I wish, I wish (Oh, I)
I wish, I wish, I wish

Uh, uh, yo' dog, I can't explain how I miss you
We stayed together, coppin' cane, poppin' pistols
I miss you most
Puttin' the doo rag over your bean head
Even out the hood on the scene you brag (Whoa)
Comin' up off the fiends for bags
Runnin' up out the cleaners, drag
You was the closest n**** I had
Look how we stayed aces
Hustled, made big faces
I wish we could trade places
F*** givin' you ice, I'd rather give you life
And the things that I had, I'd give you twice (Oh,yeah)

So what the deal, my n****, I know you holdin' it down
If you could see me you would say I'm talkin' soft
right now
But it's hard for me to see when I'mma see you again
And I know it's f***ed up, I gotta talk through this
pen
But you'd died for the love of the dough
The love of the block, 16 you was runnin' the spot
Boy, your mama used to hate how we stood on the curb
Hangin' with wild thug n****s, smokin' the herb (Mmm,
hmm, hmm)
I'm gonna keep pourin' this liquor and that's my word
This here is for n****s that be flippin' them birds
(Oh)
Word up!

Even though you know you will always be my n****
(Whoa...whoa...oh...oh..)
Even though you're gone you will also be my n****
I'm feelin' like the time when I'm high, my n**** 

I'm feelin' like time
I'm strung out, sayin', "Radio, please don't take the
n**** out this song
Let it play on, go on, on
So I had to write this song, my n****
Just to let you know that you're still my n****
[R-Kelly]

From wiping coal outta eyelids, to rap's hottest
Fake Gazelles to black Pradas
Selling nicks to trey bags, to making hits like Kidada Jones' father
OG's would send me to the store with a dollar
Hit me with some wise advice for me to follow
Ain't nothing free in the world in life 
No matter who you are, everybody got they price
And some cost more than other's
When you poor, it's like life ain't even worth living
But when you rich, it's every fat ass worth hittin'
With no chips, your drawers just stay on your hips
I play with the six cuz money make the whole world spin
But without the Franklin faces, you see who's your real friends
It's V-12's, honeys on the cell, bobbin' out the JBL
It's Nas and R. Kell

[R. Kelly]
Never thought that I'd ever live this life

Ooooooooooo-oo-ooo-oo-ooo-oo-ooo-oo-ooo baby
Baby.. tonight we'll be, naked
Oooooooh, oooooooh, oooooooh, ooooooooh
I'll take a stroll through your garden of love
and show you so so much
Just take my hand, and believe, in our fu-ture
Gettin you open like matchin doors
Sheets and covers on, the floor
And if the bell should ring, we won't answer
Girl I'll take my clothes off first, and now you
Wanna tell, what I want from you

Baby tonight I wanna see you naked
So dim the lights
Baby tonight I wanna see you naked

Oh babe, oh babe, yo' body's the reason for sight
Baby tonight I wanna see you naked
Ohhh-ohhh, naked

Down for each other for eternity, oh baby, baby
Let me know if you're out of my life
(Don't hang on) Don't hang on to my heart and say bye-bye
I used to be the one that you could call on
Now you like to play around - hit me up on what went wrong

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna hold on to your love baby
If chances are that I'm gonna fall off [2x's]

Memories like the corner of my mind
You know just what to do to make my love come down
I know just what you need, but you don't come around
Let me know if you're out of my life
Don't hang on to my heart, say bye-bye, oh baby
I used to be the one that you could call on
Now you like to play around - hit me up on what went wrong

[Chorus (2x's)]

I'm not gonna hold on to your lovin' baby
Look at what you're doing to me baby [2x's]

Baby, I'm sorry

Sorry for the things that happened to you, babe
For what he did
I'll show you that I'm not gonna do those things that he did to you
I'm gonna love you I'm gonna hold you
I'm gonna give you everythign that your heart desires
You don't have to question love
Cuz when I get home I'll show you love

I know you're hurting baby
Because of what he did
But here I am to rescue you 
From that man of sin
He took your life from you
And noted you for him
Promised you brighter days
But now your light is dim
He had no right to do
The things he did to you
If I had half a chance
Girl, I'd be good to you
Don't let don't let don't let don't let
Don't let what happened in your past hurt our future

[1] - One man can make one women hate all men
Tell me why is it that
One man can make one woman hate all men
Makes a woman hate all men
One man can make one women hate all men
I'm sorry that he took your heart and did you in

You lived your life a lie
Now it's time to seek the truth
If it takes the rest of my days 
I'm gonna make it up to you
So you let your guards on down
I don't want to go no rounds
Cuz baby, I'm here for you
Truly, truly here for you
Don't let don't let don't let don't let
Don't let what happened in the past hurt our future

While making love all the things
He said he'd do to you and he didn't girl
I'll do for you
Baby I'll do, vow to cuz I'm sorry that he took your heart
And did you in, yeah

Yes it did, yes it did, yes it did, oh, oh, oh
It mean I'm sorry baby
For coming in late from being out all night oh yeah
See I was so busy out there doing you wrong

Getting your groove on, oh, oh, oh, oh

Be careful of the bridge you burn, oh oh

Rockland
In my life
Uhh, Track Masters
You're all I need in my life
Make money
You're all I need in my life
Duece, duece
You're all I need in my life

[R]
Uh huh, yo, yo, yo, yo
I remember in the days 
Y'all niggas talking all that shit about keepin' it real
But when it comes to this game I'mma play the field
Rockland had loot before we signed the deal
Haters get in the way and catch the sky like Seal
We used to use the streets for the football field
In church free lunch was our only meal
But now we push whips with Lorenzo wheels
Living it up in Beverly Hills

[Tone]
You know 9 to 5 was only temporary
Now the ladies wanna find Tone in a hurry
Got 'em hittin' notes that Mariah couldn't carry
All you player haters going down like Mary
Cop the Rolls Royce a player with a choice
Ladies stay moist from the sound of my voice
The lady killers pass the keys to our villas
Rockland, Track Masters top billers

[1] - Only the loot can make me happy
(Nothing but the loot baby)
Happy (Show me the loot baby)
Happy (Show me the loot)

Only the loot can make me happy
(Nothing but the loot baby)
Happy (Show me the loot baby)
So happy (Show me the loot)

I never thought that I 
Could make someone like you
I felt energized 
When you went through my groove
I'll never let you go no
You're so right for me
I've got to let you know
Forever you and me
(The balla's anthem right here)

[Repeat 1]

You must be heaven sent
Sent into my life
And I compliment you honey the money
We have a love that's long 
And true I make you in many ways
I've got to roll with you
In each and every day

[Repeat 1]

You're all I need in my life
I don't need no one I don't need no one but you
You're all I need in my life
I don't need no one I don't need no one but you
I said you're all I need in my life
I don't need no one I don't need no one but you
You're all I need in my life I don't need no one
I don't need no one but you

[Repeat 1]

You're all I need in my life
I said you're all I need in my life

The war has started
Light the candles right now

When it's over there's a question asked
Who wins? Who wins?

Turn your head, close your eyes
There's people out there dying, oh
With so much wealth in the land
Why is this land starving?
As I look over this place
There's so much hatred
If I could I'd pack my bags
And hitch hike to heaven

Spirit move
Oh move

All through the land
Won't you move
Oh move, oh move, oh move

Now I was in a real bad abusive relationship
Knowing that, that was no way for me to live
A young girl like me, raised up in a good family
Way too young to endure such misery
And every night I cry myself to sleep from all the pain
And the more I prayed for sunny days it seemed to rain
(He hit me) at any given time
(He hit me) no reason at all
(He hit me) so so hard
(He hit me) my God, sometimes I'd fall
Mama asked what happened to me
And I'd take up for him
She said that devil's a liar
And pray get rid of him
And now I'm going to school
Hitting those books
I'm doing fine
He's out my life
I'm not confused
Got peace of mind
Man I tell you

I was a freshman in college and uh
I had just made it on the basketball team
I had all the skills it took to make it
But on my grades I would get nothing but all D's
And the coach came to me 
And had a talk with me about my career
Said if you don't get your grades up
I'm gonna have to sit you down this year
Man as tough as I was I broke down and cried
'Cause everybody knows me
Knows that basketball is my life
(Algebra) I studied hard
(Chemistry) I gave my all
(Calculus) oh my God
(English) so many flaws
Playing ball didn't look to good for me
My future, could not see
I had lost all my beliefs
And gave up on all my dreams
Then I went to church on Sunday
And the pastor began to preach
It was like he was talking to me
When he said I can do all things
In Christ that strengthens me
And for me that was enough
Now that I went from a D
All the way to an A plus
I tell you prayer changes things

Prayer changes 
Prayer changes (prayer)
Prayer changes (it changes things)
Prayer changes things (oh)
Prayer changes (said it changes)

Me and my wife had a few problems
We thought that nothing could solve them
Listening to family members and so called friends
Man I tell you that's just how the devil creeps in
We were separated at least for a month or two
She was wilding in the clubs
And I was out there doing wrong too
And we would walk around the house
Putting each other down
I mean right in front of the kids
We would curse each other out
Then I was in a bad accident
And almost lost my life
And guess who was there for me
My wife
Now ain't it funny how He makes a way
When we said there was no way
I'm out the hospital and back at home
Planning another wedding day, I tell you

Prayer changes things (things, I'm a witness that)
Prayer changes (change)
Prayer changes (prayer changes)

Now all of these things were happening in one family
But that's okay, cause there's nothing God can't achieve
I don't care what the problem in your life may be
Cause who the Son sets free, is free indeed
And if you didn't know, now you should know
All you have to do is take this family life for example
Now Mom and Dad are married again
Four kids now, cause they just had twins
Little sister all grown up now
She's a lawyer, married with one child now
Two years, big brother's out of college
And man he's got his hands full
Blessed with skills, blessed with knowledge
Now he's playing for the Chicago Bulls

Prayer changes (I'm a witness yeah)

[Chorus (Jay-Z)]
The power of the P-U-S-S-Y,
Thatz why every mutherfucka in the world dress fly.
Every baller
that can afford it they cop the best ride, for the power of the P-U-S-S-Y.
(Let's have some fun)
The power of the P-U-S-S-Y, thatz why niggaz get they hair cut, try to dress fly.
Every baller that can afford it he cop the best ride.
For the Power of the P-U-S-S-Y.

[Jay-Z]
I-I know this girl we call her Sweet Cooch Brown.
Hands down mami had the bombest pussy in town.
One dip in the girl pool, thatz all it took.
One sample of the snappa and ya ass was whooped.
Have you buyin Gucci sandals matchin pocketbooks.
Blowin up her beeper, ringin her phone off the hook.
Ball playaz they spent money, rappers they spent time.
All the while both claimin that they never spent a dime.
Buisness guys you were victimised.
Have 'em payin rent on condos in a Miami High Rise.
They ask her, "Who pussy's this?"
Look her right in her eyes. 
She say, "This pussy's yours, Daddy"
Tell 'em nothin but lies.
Ha! They didn't believe it, but they wanted to.
Needed to. She had the type of body that you didn't want leavin you.
So they ignored all her flirtin ways and put a ring on her finger.
I'm like, "Earth to Dave!" 

[Chorus]

[R. Kelly]
Naw..I ain't no rapper but I'mma sing my shit
when it comes down to that mutherfuckin click click click.
Niggaz I sip sip sip, turn on ya quick quick quick.
And thatz why I be givin mami much dick dick dick.
While yall chumps be copin diamonds and fur and all that,
Fiendin for this pussy as if yall was on crack.
When it comes to the truth, I can't hold back.
Ya'll cats that be babysittin  these broads need to be smacked.
It's this nigga named Monroe that I know from way back.
He hit the lotto, bought this girl a Cadillac.
Now this bitch be creepin behind this niggaz back.
Me bust his nut guess what he still took the bitch back.
Three things niggaz love...money, pussy, and drugs.
Can't get one without the other unless you soft and in love. 
Yall take it from a playa who's done all the above.
Niggaz it the lesbian R&B thug.

[Chorus]

[Devin the Dude]
The P is for the pearl tongue that I like to tickle.
The U is for uterus, down deep in the middle.
SS is so slippery when I go up inside.
Pussy's good and if you gettin some I know you know Y.
See I got my first shot when I was bout 7.
Her father called my house he said,
"I need to talk to yo son Devin.
My daughter she's 11 and she goes to the same school that yo son goes to.
And she said today she got screwed."
But my daddy answer the phone so no drama, and all he said was,
"No shit! Let me talk to that girl mama!"
Then i was suspended 3 day, tooken from school.
It was like a vacation.
Niggaz lookin at pussy at the pool in our apartments.
I started hittin hard when I was small.
Let me recite a story lesson for all of yall.
See pussy's like a wound it would never heal,
the more ointment you put on then the better it feels.
Cuz it's...

[Chorus]
[R. Kelly]
Oh yeah.

She didn't have a house, a house up in the hills
I never heard her ask for some car with the chromed out wheels
But all she wanted was some love and affection
But all I did all the time was neglect
The fact that she was lonely, I used to be her homey
I used to talk about how I was gonna get us out of the hood
But as long as we're together as a family, then it's all good

[1] - Because any man can make a baby
But it takes a real man to be a father
Talking about a family, the kid, you and me
It's not a fantasy, but it's reality
You see love is wrong and love is right
But if love is strong then love is tight
Talking about a chemistry like a bride-to-be
It's not a fantasy, but it's reality

Be careful were the words the last time we had our talk
And your truth sound absurd so my pride just let you walk
When all the time knowing that I didn't mean
To hollar out and call you bitch and tell you leave
I admit it, I was wrong but now it's over come on home
I can't take it here is where you belong
Even out the window looking for the mailman
I hope he's got a letter says, I'm missing you, in the mail
And then I saw you with another, made it hard for me to breathe
But when I played the game for gives
I should've played the game for keeps

[Repeat 1]

Now I wore the shoes that you talked about in your song
But it's been a change I've got a new pair on, yes
Now every night and day I still await
At the lonely spot in the hills
And think about how you set the record straight
Any man can

[Repeat 1 until fade]
Dearly beloved, why did you go
When being with you forever is all I hope
Slowly the rain is falling in our home
Come back and start right from going wrong
I'll be still until I hear from you
And I'll be waiting until you return this message

A religious love for you baby
Every night I pray 
That heaven will send you back to me
Baby you're all I ever needed 
Religious love for ya baby
Every night I pray 
That someday I'll have you for my wife
Baby you are my life, please believe me

For only God knows how much I miss you
And for us to be one it takes two
So don't you go dying on me not right now
Please change the impossible to somehow
I'll be still there until I hear from you
And I'll be praying until you return this message

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night, I'll be callin' you
Every single breath I take I hope to see you there
If you should ever need, if ever you need a friend
Baby I am here and don't forget to remember me

Oh baby, come to me - don't leave me lonely
I need you here with me so return this message

[Chorus]
Early one Sunday morning
Breakfast was on the table
There was no time to 
Eat
She said to me boy hurry to Sunday school
Filled with the long of glory 
We learned the holy story
She'll always have her dreams
Despite the things 

This troubled world can bring.

[CHORUS]

Oh Sadie don't you know we love you sweet Sadie

Place No one above you sweet Sadie

Well Well Well

Living in the past

Sometimes it seems so funny, no money can turn your life around

Sweeter than cotton candy
Stronger than papas' old Brandy
Always that needed 
Smile
Once in awhile she would break down and cry
Sometimes she'd be so 
Happy
Being with us and daddy
Standing the worst of times
Breaking the 
Binds with just a simple song

[CHORUS]

Oh Sadie
She's Loving my song in a special way
Sweet Sadie
Living in the 
Past
Oh she's never sinning in Love she's always winnin
My my my my my

Love you mama
I just can't forget how you gave me love oh no
If there's a 
Heaven up above I know she's teaching angels how to love
Its a mean world 
Without ya
And I surely miss you much mother
And now that your gone I'm 
Gonna carry on
Cause your cryin lady

Things that you done for me

[Chorus]

[R. Kelly]
New York, Chicago, Atlanta, L.A.

Wanna get tossed - drink that liquor
Who's got the industry locked - Kelly and Jigga
Crack my skull - turn that shit up

[Chorus]

of R&B thug and me I would say I'm probably
the hardest rapper to ever cop on poppy and

Worse than a armed robbery

You can go on clockin me, ain't nuttin gon' stop me
High as Allah I be, movin in peace but I
move with the piece, so them, dudes in the streets
will never remove my piece, ha? ha?, got me
Niggaz'll never get me, I never move sloppy
Move with the glock-50, got some Tupac with me
Let's not test my gangsta, just, raise your glasses
Mami, shake ya asses, this is a thug classic

[Lil' Kim]
Make a hole make a hole and let the Queen come past
I come through in the speedboat, with 808's in the glass
Push big things here, bet most of y'all crash
Back to trainin lightweights, you in the wrong weight class
Haters, stay awake, fuck the Harlem Shake
We "Slam" dance like Onyx, check my ebonics
You got, heat nigga you thinkin we won't blaze?
Gotta come hard cause these are the last days
When I, do it I do's it, ain't no more to it (word)
Ask Ice Cube, I puts my back into it
From car dealers to Macy's, to cashiers that brace me
We train like the Navy for whatever the case may be
I pass on the 6, they don't impress me much
I want the bulletproof 7 cause the doors lift up
They pick the best of all girls, so how y'all sound?
I got the best of both worlds, holdin me down

[Chorus]

[R] Uh-huh!

So I told shorty I be producing, I be making those beats
Be making those hits, ya know

So I said okay you may know me by my other name
Sometimes they call me

Panties and bras all the way from the bed to the sofa

Sit right there, and watch me freak yo girl chocha
Tounge all down her throat as if a nigga was trying to choke her

Out of all the girls I've loved before
Got plenty of honeys--
Puff puff give now let me hit it once more
Fake ass niggas get out and close my door
Its my house for me to live not yours
If I wanted to I could- on the floors
Through the doors like a western flick the club is crunk
Penny and Chris you know that boys tow up
About 8 or 9 black stallion riding up
Its Mr. Big screaming showdown I'm like what...

[Mr. Big]
Now Kelly-
Its not enough room in this town
For you and me so lets get down
I'm sick and tired of you and this down low fight
From contagious all the way to Mrs. Price
You done it now with Ms. Black Asia
I knew something was funny when she stopped paging
House, cars, shopping mall
Man I tell you its a battle call
Like a raging bull
I'm about to charge
Kelly, you won't see tomorrow
Its time to put a end to your late night creeps
Now any last words before my pistol speaks...

[(R. Kelly) -spits-]
Mr. Biggs-
Now no disrespect but man I'm tired
Cause all these years its my back you've been riding
We've been in and out of fights on these videos
Now its about time you felt the real rodeo
See I dated lila '98 of September
You took her from me yea right you don't remember
I remember so clearly we were coming from an opera
How clever you were when you slipped her your number
(ooh) I know that makes ya'll wanna know
(ooh) Who's really on the down low
You wonder why we're always at it there it is
Sleeves up Mr. Biggs
Cause I'm about to get- wild, wild, west
Sick and tired of your mess
You put me to the test 
And now I'm sticking out my chest
So any last words before I draw these cannons
Cause when the smoke clears I'll be the last man standing

Somebody's girl is at this party (woo!)

Somebody's girl is at this party (woo!)
Drink that glass of Cris' (that's right)
Somebody's girl is at this party (uh)
Sittin in V.I.P.
Somebody's girl (yeah) is at this party (that's right)
And she's comin home with me

[Jay-Z]
Ummmmmm.. I don't mean no harm
But your boy young Hov' got a mean ol' arm
Got all the young ladies wanna lean on him
And I don't turn them away, I'm like - bring them on
Now - where's her man is not my concern
It's not what I'm worried about, I'm just tryin to hurry her out
Clear her whole area out
And bring this whole party little nearer to my house
Now - where's her spouse?  I don't know
So, I don't ask, I don't probe
I just - get in 6, get out on Rov'
Let her, sip on Cris', go out on tours
Now - back at the lab, I'm actin bad
Cause the, pool is warm, a booze is on
Just a - select few, the fools are gone
It's slow jams and the grooves is on, groove on

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Somebody's girl is at this party
Shakin that ass to this
Somebody's girl is at this party
Drink that glass of Cris'
Somebody's girl is at this party
Sittin in V.I.P.
Somebody's girl is at this party
And she's comin home with me

[Jay-Z]
Uhh, is it my fault they call me young heat rock
Hardhead, go through walls like sheet rock
And she's comin with me, when the beat stop
When the party is done, I party with hon
Now - is it my fault you neglect your broad
and she wanna party with me, no ex at all?
No ex-boyfriend, no ex involved
Just the highway exit that we exit off
And I - fall back, I let her talk
I inquire sometime, I admire her mind
I - like her wit, I'm lovin her shoes
I'm a alternative rap, I'm playin the blues
I'm a thorough street nigga never breakin the rules
And her man's shortcomin is turnin me into somethin
that of which she has never seen
So she wanna crossover where the grass is green, knahmean?

[Chorus]

[Jay-Z]
The moral of the story if you love your bitch
you better - hold your hoe, hug your bitch
You better - slow your roll, trick some bread
When she wanna go out, you like Craig and 'em said
"See ya when I see ya," now she's callin me up
And I'm like, "Geah, of course I wanna chill"
Now she with the real, and you all fed
Like, "I'ma crack her motherfuckin fo'head!"

[Chorus]
[1] - All that money I spend
All those places I been
I can't forget you babe
Here's life without you
Working hard for this loot
Girl I wanna spend it with you 
I want you with me babe
Here's life without you

Baby, through all the ups and down
You were a lady
I wanna show you how I love you
Baby, deserve the very best
And I, I'll give it to you, only you
How can I show you that 
Only you satisfy everything that you do
Baby girl, anything that you want

Just promise me forever, boo

[Repeat 1]

Baby I can't imagine life without you
With me, I never want to be without you
Baby, I want you to believe it's true 
All that I do, I do for you
How can I show you that
Only you could satisfy, everything that you do
Anything that you want I'll give to you 
Just promise me forever, boo

[Repeat 1]

Don't know why you stayed by my side for so long
So I dedicate baby, in every way 
All my heart and soul
It all belongs to you

[Repeat 1 until fade]
I can see my destination , I can hear my call
No more hesitation this time I'm going for all
Cause I know where this road leads to and therefore I will rise,
I know this dream will come true, an I will soar the sky

Spirit spirit would you guide me
Spirit spirit stand by me
C'mon and c'mon and c'mon and

I can feel the penetration, of a strong wind moving me
I can feel the elevation, of an angel lifting me,
Cause i know where this road leads to and therefore I will rise
I know this dream will come true, an I will soar the sky

Spirit spirit would you guide me

Many lovers has come, and
Many lovers have gone.
Similar to an old fashion song
(A thousand years from now
We'll be still putting it down my baby.)

You can change the frame, 
But the picture remains the same.
Similar to the sun after the rain.
(Thousand years from now, we'll
Be still puttin' it down my baby)

Baby girl in other words for ever more

(Clap in the name of love) (Clap my hands yeah) 
(Step in the name of love) (Step from side to side)
(Groove in the name of love) (Grooove and it's alright)

Some believes in love,
And some people don't
Similar to a story, when it's told.
A thousand years from now
We'll be still puttin' down my baby
Some have cross the finish line and some gave up.
It's like moving a mountain 
Love can be just that tough yeah.

Baby girl in other words for ever more
I'll be here. (I'll be here.)
Cause my whole has been full of joy since

And get your body real open, baby
Do what you been hopin', baby
Tonight I'm gonna pull a switcheroo
Do you mind if I strip for you?

Now I'ma stop and get some gas, my baby
That gives you time to freshen up, my baby
And if you want, just leave the door unlocked
I'll be creepin' in 'bout 12 o'clock
So turn the telephones off, my baby
No interruptions while I'm driving you crazy
Girl, I want you to know tonight is yours
Start in the bed and end up on the floor

There'll be
Three knocks at the door, my baby (three knocks)
Trench coat hits the floor, my baby

Slowly rolling
For you (for you)
Whatever you want me to do

[1] - I say the easiest thing in the world
Is to love you
And the hardest thing in the world
Is to lose you

Said I tried and tried again to keep you 
But it just ain't no use
I'm baffled cuz of what went down
See I got your letter so you're leaving town
Just take one minute to think about
Baby, lets back track on what happened in this house
Now I remember clearly it was a Saturday
I came walkin' in four o'clock in the morning
And I thought you were sleepin' one eye opened
You turned and said to me where the hell you been
Then I turned it around and hollared with some friends drinking
And now I'm sitting here all alone
Wishing you were here to house this home, oh

Say the easiest thing in the world is to love you 
I love you baby
And the hardest thing in the world (So hard) 
Is to lose you (Is to lose you baby)

[2] - Now I'm sitting here sippin' on things 
I'm not suppose to (Sittin right here)
And that ain't cool (You know that ain't cool)
I've got to get over losing you

Shattered I can't believe you're gone
I'm left in the middle of these four walls
Lying helpless 'bout to lose my mind baby
I can't fathom life without you by my side
Now every night before I go to sleep
I pray to heaven for a better me
Nights I'm up thinkin' and days I'm up dreamin' 
You were at work I was at play
A nigga wanted you and plus his cake
I know I ain't got no right to say
But I need you to head on back this way
Because I'm sitting here all alone
Wishing you were here to house this home

[Repeat 1]
[Repeat 2]

Baby can't we just moan for love like we used to

[Repeat 1]
[Repeat 2]

See, sometimes we men, we can dish it out
But sometimes we men, we can't take it, hey
So I'm gonna get up out this chair
And catch me a train, and get where you are, hey
Because I love you babe
And i need you 
Right here by my side
Ghetto woman come on home to me
I'm dying sorry and I can't seem to break free
Girl, you know you knock me out
You're a real girl with your looks now baby
Girl you know you knock me out

*Summer bunnies drive me crazy
[repeat 4 times with ad libs]

1,2,3,4 it's time for me to jet
Where ya goin' off to?
The beach, that's a bet
It's summertime so it's time to get a summer bunny

Some of those and I won't call 'em whores
'Cause in the 90s you gotta respect the ladies
So step up to 'em and say, we love you sweet Sadie
That's how you get your true mock on but
Brothers be steppin' up poppin' that sad song

Hey don't I know you from somewhere?
Can we go somewhere to be alone?
I pull up in the lot, pop the trunks
Make their heads bob
And it's sunny so it's time to get a summer bunny

[*Repeat]

It's five o'clock and my voice code is 22
So beep, beep, beep, it's time for me to make a move
I'm on my way to a picnic, we got time
But I wanna be early, fool
So I can catch the new bunnies comin' in
Like the old school

Strollin' the block so I can check the scenery
The sun plays, the day is feelin' good to me
I can just semll the funky beats
You know the flavor in between the sheets

I told my boy Big Al, said just keep it straight
Said, I know I got a novelty to validate
So who's the bunny lookin' sweet like a honeycomb?
He said, "No my brother, you got to get your own"

[*Repeat]

This party is packed, word to the mother
I love it when there's three bunnies to one brother
And wine coolers is what I'm packin'
And when I get my buzz on is when I start bunny-jackin'

Jackin' fools for their bunnies
'Cause I'm the K, the E, the double L, the Y
They wanna get with me
And the PAs in the house
So check, check, check it out

My stomach is growlin' so it's time to get mine on
Some soul food, Kool Aid and you know it's on
I hate to eat and run but I'm out my homie
Been invited to a block party

So we roll up in all our style
With the brothers yellin', summer bunnies

[*Repeat]

Let's break it down -
You're lookin' feel good with your boots on, baby [3 times]

[Jay-Z]
Uh, uhh uhh, Kel's
Young, M, X, tra, money, let's go

[Chorus 2X: R. Kelly + (Girl)]
Girl you know you got a body-adi-adi (do you like it?)
Where you get your little body-adi-adi (do you want it?)
Girl I wanna freak your body-adi-adi (what you want it?)
I just wanna take you home with me

[Jay-Z]
She get it from her momma..
You can't tie a sweater over that ass, it hotter than pajamas
We lay back, blowin ganja
DVD, she make it hard to watch a flat TV - WHOA
I crept up behind her
Mami threw it like a quarterback, I caught that like Rice
I call mami Montana, bandana
Tied her hands up - this is gangsta love
Threw on a rap CD, we gangsta fucked
This ain't R&B smooth, I ain't a R&B dude
Poured a glass of Army, got mami in the mood
Then she stripped for me like the "Moulin Rouge"
I think I might wife her
Y'know, powder blue Roc-a-Wear suit, white Nike her
Add mami to the cypher
R.O.C. for life cuz, the gang motherfucker

[Chorus]

[R. Kelly]
I make ya hotter than the next bitch - no need
for you to ever sweat the next bitch - with speed
I make the next bitch see the exit - indeed
Gotta know you're ver-ily respected - by me
You get the keys to the Lexus - but no drive
You get your own 2002, she through ridin
Keep yo' ass tighter than Versace
That's why you gotta watch yo' friends
You gotta watch me, they connivin shit
See I just wanna freak your body-adi-adi
I know you don't do this for everybody-adi
But everybody ain't as horny as me
And your body's - callin, me...

[Chorus]

[Jay-Z]
Uhh, yeah
Mami shot through the pad with the Mark Jacobs bag
The thick stitched seam and her favorite ass jeans
Y'all know the first date wearers
to make objects bigger than they appear like a rearview mirror
Oh her shoe game is real
She gave 'em the Christian Libountins(?) with the four inch heels
But honestly my favorite type of gear
is a scrungy for her hair and LaPearla underwear, clear?

[R. Kelly]
Girl I hear you callin, let's stop stallin
Do what we came to do
Girl I hear you callin, let's stop stallin
Baby I want you, yeah

[Chorus]
What's up baby
I know what you're thinking
What did I call you over here for 
I wanna take you somewhere

[Chorus]
Tempo slow, lights down low
Let me take you to a place
Where only love grooves go

Step into my territory 
And let the vibes begin
Don't be afraid
Just let this love groove in
Let the passion lead you to a place beyond
Exploring my bedroom, having freaky fun

[Chorus]

All the players go
All the gangstas go

[Chorus]

Rules they are so simple, so very simple
As our bodies connect 
And those juices start to flow
Makin' sweet love 'til the morning light
And satisfying love's appetite

[Chorus (2x's)]

Baby tell Daddy what it is you want
Come on and unravel those little secrets unknown
Time to taste what love has in store for me
So let's take a sip of this love groove chemistry

[Chorus (3x's)]
Finally the weekend's come 
And everything is goin' down
Nine to five and now it's time 
For me to get around
Good poppin' ain't no stoppin' everybody's in the mood
Mind blowin' once you feel the music startin' to get to you
Disco nights, party lights, it's all good for me

[1] - Thank God it's Friday
Party lights, Friday night feelin' right
It's a party
Thank God it's Friday
Party lights, Friday night feelin' right

Take some time out for yourself 
And let this Friday get to you

Oh God, thank you for Friday

Look behind myself
As I reflect on all the memories
The times they come and go
Lost everything from friends to Family
If I could turn back the hands
There would be some things I'd change about me
I know that my past is not what my future holds

Where I come from
Who could believe
All the pain and misery
Look in my eyes and you'll see
The diary of me

Rewind my life
Just go back and correct all the wrong
And ask God to direct my path
So that I can make it home
And if I could turn back the hands of time
There would be some things I would change about me
But I know that my past is not what my future holds
'Cause

Where I'm from
Who could believe
All the pain, misery
Look in my eyes and you will see
The diary of me

Years ago a child was born (a child was born) (ooh)
And raised without a man (without my... father, and wonder why he's in these streets) (ooh)

My mother's gone (mothers gone, yet still... found the strength to pray for me) (ooh)
But still reached out her hand
Just open the book (na-na-na-na-na-na)
Turn the pages of my life (na-na-na)
And you will read
A true story about one man's journey

Where I'm from (ahh...)
Who would believe, yeah
That all the hurt and pain and misery (ahh...)
Look in my eyes (ahh...)
You'll see the diary of me (pum-pum-pum-pum-pum)
Where I'm from (where I'm from, who could believe) (ahh...)
Who could believe (the hurt and pain and misery)
(Look in my eyes) in my eyes (and you will see) (ahh...)
(The makings of) the makings of
(My diary) my diary
(Where I'm from) look in my eyes (ahh...)
(Who could believe) you'll see
(The hurt and pain and misery)
(Look in my eyes) (ahh...)
(And you will see) yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
(The makings of my diary)
(Where I'm from...) (ahh...)
From beyond this bed of mine I see
Ceiling fans with you on top of me
And the window blinds are filled with rays of sun
And all you secret fantasies thy will be done (done)
And inside of your walls there will dwell a Capricorn 
(that will feast your body all night)
If we keep this up then a love child will be born
All because
Of the greatest

[chorus]
The greatest you
The greatest me
We have found the greatest chemistry
The greatest touch 
The greatest kiss
What came to be is the greatest wish
The greatest show
The greatest song
The greatest words
The greatest all night long 
Baby your love stays constantly on my mind
This is the best sex I've ever had

I know twelve ways to make your love come down
And the secret places on you will be found
Like a voyage when the storm begins to roar 
There's no telling what this night could have in store (in store)
Cause inside of your walls there will dwell a capricorn 
(that will feast your body all night)
And if we keep this up then a love child will be born
All because
Of the greatest

[chorus]
The greatest you

The greatest show
The greatest song
The greatest words
The greatest all night long 
Baby your love stays constantly on my mind
This is the best sex I've ever had

Something heaven has ordained for the sake of our love
Like a hand and glove we go together this love is forever oooh

This sex is so good I've got to break it down

And see if you can step to this one
Another one for the ladies 
Coming from the Chocolate Factory

Your music weatherman

We wanna send out a shout out to all the birthday people
All the birthday people today
So we gonna send this one out to ya'll
Happy People baby!
Enter into my room
Dim the lights and hop right into bed with me
I will satisfy your needs going half on a baby
Are you down with me

Dearly be are you down with me
Half on a baby are you down with me
Dearly be are you down with me
Half on a baby are you down
Going half, going half, going half
Going half, going half, on a baby
I was in a tunnel
And couldn't see the light
And whenever I'd look up
I couldn't see the sky
Sometimes when I'm standin'
It seems like I done walked for miles
And my heart could be cryin'
Dead in the middle of a smile

But then I climbed the hills
And saw the mountains
I hollered help 'cause I was lost
Then I felt the strong wind
Heard a small voice sayin'

The storm is over
(The storm is over now)
And I can see the sunshine
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
I feel Heaven, yeah
(Heaven is over me)
Come on and set me free, whoa

Now in the midst of my battle
All hope was gone
Downtown in a rushed crowd
And felt all alone
And every now and then
I felt like I would lose my mind
I've been racin' for years
And still no finish line, oh

But then I climbed the hills
And saw the mountains (Mountains)
I hollered help 'cause I was lost
Then I felt the strong wind
And then a small voice sayin'

The storm is over
(The storm is over now)
And I can see the sunshine
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
I can feel Heaven, yeah
(Heaven is over me)

Come on and set me free

Somehow my beginning stepped right in (Right in)
Then faith became my friend (My friend)
And now I can depend
On the voices of the wind
When it's sayin' (Sayin')

The storm is over
(The storm is over now)
And I can see the sunshine
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
I can feel Heaven, yeah
(Heaven is over me)

Won't you come and set me free
Won't you set me free

The storm is over
(The storm is over now)
And I can see the sunshine
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
I can feel Heaven, yeah
(Heaven is over me)
Won't you come and set me free

[Ad lib until fade]
Dear God.. how can I explain myself?
[J] Oh God bless me indeed
When I'm so confused
[J] Enlarge my territory
[J] Place your love and protection over me at all times
Help me!
[J] Keep me away from evil
Somebody answer me! [echoes]
[J] Allow me not to cause pain

[Jay-Z]
Police in the background, screamin put the thing down
That's how hard I was trying to put my thing down
Si-rens ringin out, old ladies screamin out
All this attention for me and I'm barely sixteen now
.. it's feelin like a dream now
Handcuffed, roughed up, I'm tossed in the bing now
I'm lyin next to fiends now, that's the end of the story
Let me bring y'all niggaz back to the very first scene now
December 4th, a child is born
Before I knew it, had my pops trousers on
That's how we do it when the man of the house is gone
You either, stand or fall, I chose to stand
The hawk outside, so I blow my hand
It's a cold cold world but I overstand
Tryin to stay focused but I feel hopeless damn
Can't cope with bein broke, I'm a man - c'mon

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Son don't let these streets, get the best of you
I will be right by your side, when you goin through
Son just don't let it (just don't let it)
Just don't let it (just don't let it)
Just don't let it (just don't let it)
.. get the best of you

[R. Kelly]
Late one night I was, rollin the streets
Just, thinkin about what's goin on with me and
trapped in this thug life, tryin to break free but
this thug life just keeps callin me
I'm livin life way too dangerously
I'm drownin in my misery
Looked in the mirror, there's my enemy
Cause poppa never was a part of me
Take one step at a time, mama said
Sweet memories still remain in my head
All of my life been lied to, misled
Voices be like, "Don't you wish you was dead?"
No ground to place my feet
I feel the fire under me
A way out is all I need
Somebody, answer me!

[Chorus + ad libs]

[Jay-Z]
Now the only thing left is more spirit to roam free
.. cause ain't no goin home for me
It's a cold cold world but I blew my hand
A true first cause I knew that man
I knew what he would do if I didn't draw first
And I couldn't stand the thought of my momma steppin foot inside a church
All I try to do is try to get up out the dirt
Guess he's tryin to do the same, told me get up out his turf
I wanted to talk to him, but that shit'd never work
We was cut from the same cloth and what was under his shirt was his
momma's rent, his young brother's clothes
My nephew's food, and with that I suppose
.. and with that I froze
Now my life is frozen in time behind these iron folds
And this story is told, for young soldiers
who never choose the life we chose

[Chorus + (ad libs)]

[R. Kelly]
Tears in my eyes as I look up, I'm tryin to
hold back my pride but reality is screamin
Gotta get a job cause mo-mma also screamin
Streets are just like drugs, and it's like I'm out here fiendin
Forget all the hits in the industry, cause
ain't no exceptions in this game for me, look
Neither God or my enemies, I
choose God cause he understands, this
young man with a thuggish heart
Whole world in his hands but still torn apart
Like I'm so close, but it's still so far
Nightmares of me in a swervin car, ohhh
No ground to place my feet (my feet)
I feel the fire under me (heyyy)
A way out is all I need (all I need)
Somebody, answer me!

[Chorus + ad libs]
Hit it hard from the back
Roll around on the front
I know you've heard a lot of tracks
But 12 Play is what you want
Just let me call the studio
Then we can go all night
Girl I hope you can hang
Cause I'm horny as hell tonight

One
Taking off your Secrets with my teeth
Two 
Slightly rough to let you know it's about to get kinky
Three
Blind your eyes, then I walk you to my bedroom
Four
Now open your eyes 
Surprise you've entered twelve play two

Stop
We need to catch our breath
We've been going for a while
It's been about two hours
And we're still going round for round
The water's getting cold
And the movie's going off
This is how we do in TP-2

Five 
I'm about to take you for a ride
Now feel it come inside
Six
Baby it's as hard as a brick
Tell me can you feel this sh, sh, sh
Seven
That's when to slow it down
Cause I'm not ready to
Eight
We're almost at the peak
Cause I'm feeling tingly

Now flew your body like, what (what, what)
It's like diamonds with the cut (cut, cut)
The hottest out of your friends
The way you take it from me
Girl you put it on me like draws
Moaning when you talk
I'm about to tear your shit out
New millennium style

Nine
Lookin' you in your eyes
As I'm about to do that thing
Ten
Then on down to your thighs 
I'm gonna make you scream
Eleven
Now put your body on top of me
I'm about to grab your waist
Twelve 
Now quick before we get to thirteen
Set it on my face
[Chorus]
Trade in my life 
Oh for you, oh yes, oh yes
Trade in my life for you

Sittin' here wonderin' how did things go wrong
Every night asking myself what happened to our happy home
Will I ever see you again, I need to know my friend
Now the past has gone away but tomorrow's on it's way
Though the sun is going down, I need you around
I'm willing to trade in my life

[Chorus]
Now I'm sitting here 
Reminiscing on what we used to share
And how we used to be such a happy pair, oh yeah
I cannot believe we've thrown it all away
Tell me will I see you again someday?

Now the past is gone away 
But tomorrow's on it's way
Though the sun is going down
And I need you around - trade

[Chorus]

We both know that we made a vow 
Said we'd always be together
That our love would endure, yes
But now you're gone and I'm all alone
But I need you here and I'm willing to trade it

[Chorus]

I mean it from the bottom of my heart
Tell me are you with me, are you willing to trade it

And I don't even have to think about it twice
Hey, I'll trade it
Somebody help me say I'll trade it
Until you return to me
I'm gonna stay on my hands and knees
And when I see you I'm gonna stand up
And reach my hands out to you, and trade it

Said I love my music and I love my fans
But I've got to step back
Look at this thing like it sure enough is
Tell me do you remember when we used to say
Everything is in their love tell me

What does it profit a man
To gain the world and lose his soul?
I'm gonna trade it to be with you

I was riding in my car one day
In the express lane rollin on the freeway
And suddenly the phone rings then I
Reached down beside me then i look
On the floor felt on the backseat
See I was drinking while I was driving
Never thinking bout what I was doing
I turned around and before i knew it
Here comes this truck now

Doctor said don't think he gonna make it
Family said make the funeral arrangements
Unplug the machine he's gone now 
Then told my wife to be strong now
Then a small voice said told me
If you promise to stop drinking
I surrendered on that day
Now for ten years i've been straight

You saved me [4x]
Gave me a second chance
You saved me [3x]
You saved me

Now i've been sitting in this chair
Waiting on the phone to ring
Praying up to God that someone will call
Me with a job opening
Cause it's been so hard for me
Month to month struggling to eat
But still there was no answer
I stop believing in his word and
Got so mad at him and
When somebody said God's good
I just laugh at 'em

But in the nick of time his blessing
Rain on me
By his grace the phone ring
A lady said were hiring and 
That's when I knew

You saved me [4x]

Now i was 18 out there on the block
Selling drugs
With a gun at my waist
And for people I had no love
See the streets was my home
Family and friends were all gone
Had no one to trust
And deep inside i was all alone
And a deal went bad one day
And it was enough to pause me
I was shot 4 times and before i
Knew it I was on my knees

Blood pushin out my body
My heart's beating faster don't know what i'm gonna do
I don't think i'm gonna last then
I begain to flash back on the things
I done in my past
Then I heard a small voice that said
I'll give you peace if you believe
I accepted Christ that day
Halilujah now i'm free

You saved me [4x]

I was in the aisle of the grocery store
With a pain in my chest and I'm wondering
Where did it come from (I got tested)
And the results came back 
And the doctor said i'm sorry but u got cancer
I could not beleive it so 
I call my mama to calm my nerves

(mama) she got down on her knees
(mama) she said a prayer for me
(mama) just keep on thanking Jesus
(mama) he'll give you what you need
(thank you Jesus)
Now that was five years ago
I don't have that pain no more
Doc said you can go home
Cause all your cancer's gone

You saved me [4x]

You saved me (said you saved me)
You saved me (but you saved me)
You saved me saaaved me
Gave me a second chance (second chance)
Halilujah saved me
Saved me saved me
Wooooooh You saved me

You gave me it was by grace You saved me
I'm so thankful that You looked down on me
Saw me standing there
I was at the end of my rope no where to go
And you gave me

No where to go (and you saved me)
I was down and out 2 
I was doing drugs 2
I was running the streets 2
Never felt love
I was wilding out
You saved me
You stepped in ooh save me

You saved me
Rock on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Chillin' at the club
Showing niggas how we ball
Ever since the drought
It's been nothing but the trump

Shop lifters with Benini schemes
Smoke greenie green candyman up in cabrini green
Some cats I know like to splurge on they wrists

To all my ballers lockin' ice, getting a room for the night
Taking first class flights, we ride, we ride
(From Chitown to LA)

[Noreaga]
Yo, I used to be in Chitown and collect panties

Thugged out yo, all my people givin' eye jammies
Now them shorties say I'm cute, when they can't stand me

Everything that we spit on is platinum gold
But now it's for the love, for all the players and the thugs
Yo, it's a party goin' on, meet me right at the club
We got some chickens in the living room getting it on
And they ain't leaving 'till six in the morning
Thugged out, my people gettin' head while we on and
Tear the club up every time we performin'
Gun up in your waist, please don't shoot up the place
Because this shorty right here, lookin' good in my face
Ay yo, it's so deep I told shorty just last week
Uh huh, it's like, you remind me of my jeep

[Repeat 1]

[Vegas Cats]
Only ballers be allowed up in here
Money makers got my thug niggas watchin' my rear for player haters
Eighteen and I'm livin' a dream, go figure
How a nigga that's younger than you, ice bigger
Don't sweat that, stick to rap nigga, try that
Call my nigga R. Kell if you need a hit, black
And when you get it, make it known baby, who did it
It'll make your fans hit the stores and go get it
Now, here come a bitter sweet note for the fellas
Left out the club with her friend, now she jealous
Mad cuz she can't ride in the LS
Yeah, she kinda mad but a baller could care less
While you sleep, sleep, sleep
I'm inna Benz going beep, beep, beep
Got your girl sayin' "Yo, who he?"
So let's ride to Rockland's party, uh huh

[Jay-Z]
Check, Ghetto pro' federal
Jay-Z shake the dice, let 'em go
Bet a load I tear down every show
Better know cheddar crowed like the front babe row
Says R., Jay y'all, all I need is four bars
I'm hotter than a lotta men
Switch up cars like Rodman's hair color, then hit your broad
I'm borderline too much for the mortal mind
Every time you ought to rewind, find there's more to find 
Now pop that cork, then pour the wine
Represent New York to Chitown, like what
Floss mine, like of course my, what
Never cross my family, can we all get along? Hell no
I'm tryin' to tell y'all who dat is that rule that biz
Not your baby daddy but Jay-Z, true that is
Better school that kid on who's shoes that is
Or who I be nigga, V.I.P Jigga

[Repeat 1]

[R.]
Let's get together and make this loot
(Trackmasters, Rockland)
Make this loot
(Untertainment)
Come on players
(Thugged out)
Come on players
(And we out like that)
Rock-a-fella ya'll
I'm sick and tired of the games you played
Every move I make your ass got something to say
Scandalize my name when you see it in the paper
Trying to turn it all around when it wasn't that way
Everybody is trying to figure me out
What the hell is wrong with y'all just let me live my life
I can't go one day without y'all in my face
Y'all done lost y'all minds if you don't hear what I say
Cops chase me when I'm standing still
You know I ain't done shit wrong so why you want me in your cell
You don't like my songs well it pays the bills
And you cut me down cuz I keep it real
Sometimes I wanna fly far away from here
To another place it ain't worth these tears
Sometimes at night when I close my eyes
I know the haters are busy making up hater lies
Sometimes I laugh trying to keep from crying
If I was plain out of love then tell me who could I trust
See I work so hard just to get ahead
If it wasn't for God I'd probably be dead
Sometimes I think y'all trying to pull me down
But y'all wasting your time I got you haters figured out
If yo had your way it'd be lock and key
Everywhere I go trouble follows me
Where the hell is my father shit it hurts sometimes
There's a hole in me and it rocks my mind

Forgive me father for I have sinned
When was your last confession

His true fears he left without a care
And that was more than I could bare
When you need my help I never tell you no
When I need your love you got somewhere to go
I'm getting sick of this shit but I'm not gonna quit
I've come too far gotta keep my pockets thick
I get mad as hell but that's ok
Kick off these shoes cuz I'm here to stay
I gotta let you know got no time to play
So feel me and all that you hear me say
What I'm building up you can't tear it down
Cuz it's built on solid Rockland ground
We don't die, we multiply, hit after hit, living platinum style
Keep my head up high, looking toward the sky
Nothing inmy view, hey I can fly
Y'all just hate, I can't take no more
And if you feel me raise your hand and show

This is what I feel, ooh, this is what I feel
Feel me, feel me, feel me, hey, hey feel, woo
Westside tell me can you feel me, hey, oh
Eastside tell me can you feel me, whoa, oh south
Southside tell me can you feel me
Feel me, feel me
I'm standing here looking in the mirror
Saying "damn" to myself
I should have known the day would come
That she would find somebody else
And all the things I took her through 
Shit, I shouldn't have lasted this long
Now I'm at this telephone booth calling Tyrone

[1] - Cuz when a woman's fed up
(No matter how you beg, no)
It ain't nothing you can do about it
(Nothing you can do about it)
It's like running out of love
(No matter what you say, no)
And then it's too late to talk about it
(Too late to talk about it)

Now let's talk about how it all goes down
I used to make love to you daily
When the night fell the same
And anytime that you were hurt
I could feel your pain
And if I had a dollar
It was yours, yeah
And whenever we would go out
I would front the bill 
But now the up is down
And the silence is sound
I hurt you too too many times
Now I can't come around

[1] - Cuz when a woman's fed up
(No matter how you beg, no)
It ain't nothing you can do about it
(Nothing you can do about it)
It's like running out of love
(No matter what you say, no)
And then it's too late to talk about it
(Too late to talk about it)

La da da da da la la da da
La da da da da la la da da
If you don't want to find out the hard way
Then listen to this song while the record plays

[1] - Cuz when a woman's fed up
(No matter how you beg, no)
It ain't nothing you can do about it
(Nothing you can do about it)
It's like running out of love
(No matter what you say, no)
And then it's too late to talk about it
(Too late to talk about it)

You can cry a river 
'Till an ocean starts to form, yeah
But she will always remember 
Cuz she's a woman scorned
And if you ever get her back
It will never be the same
She's cuttin' the corners of her eyes
Every time she see your face
Now your trust is out the door
She don't want you no more
You used to tell your boys, not me
And she would always be there for you
If you had took the time to see 
What that woman meant to you
Is what the mirror said to me, whoa
She was raised in Illinois 
Right outside of Chicago
Some of the best cookin' you ever had
Yes, it was and I miss her
Hey woman, if you're listening
I said I miss you baby
When I wake up in the morning time and see the sun I say
Hallelujah, thank you Jesus for waking me up today
I think about his goodness and the wonderful things he's done;
Forgiving me, setting me free and casting my sins away
And soon as I was about to fall you stepped right in on time
Picked me up, and let me know you had nothing but love for me
And those lonely nights when I thought that I gonna lose my mind (my mind)
Lord, You were my company

And now I feel joy (when I think about you)
I feel strength (when I think about you)
No pain (when I think about you)
And no rain (when I think about you)
I get glad (when I think about you)
And raise my hands (when I think about you)
Shout your name (when I think about you)
(When I think about you)

And in the midst of the storm you were the shelter in my life
Even though (I was doing wrong) and even though (I fell off)
No-one can help me out, the way you helped me whenever I was in need
When trouble was chasing, I was weak (mmm) you kept your hands on me
My God you sacrifised you life that I might live for eternity
Despite my faults, you heard my cry (yes you did) and forgave my inequity
No-one can understand, the way you understand when it comes to my heart
Lord you gave me a brand new start

And now I feel joy (when I think about you)
Feel strength (when I think about you)
There is no pain (when I think about you)
No rain (when I think about you)
I get glad (when I think about you)
Raise my hands (when I think about you)
And shout your name (when I think about you) Oh Lord
(When I think about you)

Listen
Even though your doubts will come (doubts will come)
Believe he gave his only son (all of the world) to all the world
He chose to love (oh, yes he did) so how can we not (how can we not) send our praises up

I feel joy (when I think about you)
Feel strength, yeah (when I think about you)
There's no rain (when I think about you)
No more pain (when I think about you)
I get glad, ohh (when I think about you)
Then I raise my hands (when I think about you)
Shout your name (when I think about you) oh I
(When I think about you)
I feel joy (when I think about you)
And peace (when I think about you)
Feel your presence (when I think about you)
Coming over me (when I think about you)
Then I start to fall, yeah (when I think about you)
Down to my knees (when I think about you)
And begin to pray (when I think about you) Lord help me
(When I think about you)
Then I see the light (when I think about you)
Startin' to shine right through (when I think about you)
It's a brand new day (when I think about you)
And my heart's renewed (when I think about you)
And all my fears are gone (when I think about you)
Away (when I think about you)
When my day looks cloudy (when I think about you)
It's gonna be okay (When I think about you)
Yeah-ohh-no (when I think about you)
(When I think about you)
How you gave me love (gave me love) (when I think about you)
And I gave you nothing (gave you nothing) (when I think about you)
How you woke me up (hey!) (when I think about you)
And started me on my way (started me on my way) (when I think about you)
See you did not have to do it (when I think about you)
But you did it any old way (when I think about you)
Any old, any old, any old way (when I think about you)
Yes you did, yes you did (when I think about you)
Yes you did, yes you did (when I think about you)
Yes you did, (when I think about you)
Hey-hey-hey-hey (when I think about you)
Hey-hey-hey-hey (when I think about you)
Hey-hey-hey-hey (when I think about you)
Hey-hey-hey whoo
Oh yes (uh) (when I think about you)
(When I think about you)
(When I think about you)
(When I think about you)

My heart stopped said what is this just
As soon as you started talking
Something happened deep within me (well)
All of a sudden I got this feeling
A chill came from feet to head and then I
Turned away from you and said to myself
This is not supposed to happen brother you’ve been hurt too many times before
First I tripped, then I slipped, then I fell

You made me love you
You made me love you babe, made me love you babe
Made me love you babe, (oh Lord) made me love you babe
Said you made me love you
You made me love you babe, made me love you babe
Made me love you babe, (good Lord) made me love you babe
You made me love you babe, made me love you babe
Made me love you babe, (said it wasn’t in my plans) made me love you babe
Ooh, look at you

Said you must be one of the top models
Body curved like a pop bottle
Got me sweating like a boxer baby
I done stumbled up on a perfect lady (awww)
Could this be what heaven sent to me
An angel come to set me free
Love has been a stranger to me
And myself keeps telling me that
This is not supposed to happen brother you’ve been hurt too many times before
First I tripped, then I slipped, then I fell

You made me love you
You made me love you babe, (oh yes) made me love you babe
Made me love you babe, (hoo) made me love you babe
Hey you made me love you
You made me love you babe, made me love you babe (yeah)
Made me love you babe, (aw baby) made me love you babe
You made love you
You made me love you babe, made me love you babe (aw love)
Made me love you babe, made me love you babe

Said the power of love you see 
Are 10 billion wonders to me (like the moon and stars above)
There’s a whole new world for my eyes to see (yes sir)
So much joy darling you put in me
And now the sun is shining where there used to be rain, oh Lord
And now no more loneliness, no more hurt, no more pain

You made whoo!

Made me love you babe, made me love you babe

Made me love you babe, made me love you babe

Made me love you babe, made me love you babe

Cause tonight, I'm gonna give you all the little things 
I know you've been waiting for
So, brace yourself and listen

I hear you callin', "Here I come baby"
To save you, oh oh
Baby no more stallin'
These hands have been longing to touch you baby
And now that you've come around, to seein' it my way
You won't regret it baby, and you surely won't forget it baby
It's unbelieveable how your body's calling for me
I can just hear it callin' callin' for me

[1] - My Body's callin' for you
My Body's callin' for You
My Body's callin' for you
My Body's callin' for You

Tell me, what's your desire
Baby your wish is my deal oh yes it is baby
Let me take you higher
Show you how you should feel, baby
Oh So we speak now and forever hold your body
Whatever it is you want from me, baby
You see you don't have to say nothing
Knowing your body wants something
And it's easy for me to see 
That your body's callin' for me

[Repeat 1]

I'm listening baby
I hear you callin' me
I'm listening baby
I hear you callin' me
I'm listening baby
I hear you callin' me
I'm listening baby
I hear you callin' me

[Repeat 1 until fade out]
You remind me of something
I just can't think of what it is

[1] - You remind me of my jeep, I wanna ride it
Something like my sound, I wanna pump it
Girl you look just like my cars, I wanna wax it
And something like my bank account
I wanna spend it, baby

It's something about your love that's got me going crazy
Baby, you know I want you real bad
And girl I really like your freaky style
How can I be down with you?
So get a little closer to my ride
I wanna get to know you lady
And hip me up on how to get inside you
Listen, pretty baby

[2] - I wanna roll it, roll it, roll it, roll it
Is all I wanna do for you baby
Girl, it's something kind of sexy
Goin' on about you babe
[repeat 1, 1]

Now I would like to take you on a ride tonight
Girl, you know we'll have so much fun
And give you everything your body needs
Satisfaction guaranteed
So pull up to my bumper and let the system sound
Girl, I bet cha' I can drive you crazy
And let me be the one to drop you off
Babe, listen to me
[rpt 2, 1, 1...1]

Don't be alone, don't be alone
I'm comin' through your door
Turn off the lights, turn off the lights, baby
It's something about this moment
[rpt 1, 1, 1...]
Everyday and night I pray 
Love will swing you back this way
Life without you here with me 
Ain't the same without you G

Baby hear me, I never meant to hurt you
Baby come and talk to me
Let me know what's on your mind
Every time I see you
You're running from me all the time

Baby hear me, I never meant to hurt you
I only wanted you to be happy
You to have the best of things
To be down with me, baby
'Cause your lovin', it's so good

You're giving me the run-around
Thought our love was going down
Baby don't you know
That I'm down until the day I die
Baby hear me, never meant to hurt you
Now you know I'll never do anything to hurt you
'Cause baby I love you

Every night and day I pray
Your love returns
Oh I'd give my life
If it would only make you happy

[Rap (Notorious B.I.G)]
Sittin' reminiscin' on when you started dissin'
Spittin' in faces in public places
Rolexes with faces had you chipper for months
Made some dough, did some shows, now you're starting to front
Smokin' blunts on the veranda with Amanda
She's fillin' your head with he said, she said
Poppa doin' this, Poppa doin' that
But don't tell him I said it 'cause my Jeep might get wetted
Forget it, go on take her word like the Koran
Ya'll stay friends, I'll stay and smoke Phil Benzs
I regret Putting you on to Bagguettes.
Honeysuckle sets, Biggie secret pyjama sets
You were the Reebok vandal, now you were Chanel sandals
I made you - why would I play you?
Think about it while the streets you roam
It's all peas and crispies in the fridge when you get home

[Chorus]
You to be, be happy
You to have the best of things
Baby everything you want it for baby
You to be down with me
So give me that ass back baby
'Cause your lovin' is so good, so damn good, babe

Everyday and night I pray love will swing you back this way
Life without you here with me ain't the same without you G

[Chorus]
