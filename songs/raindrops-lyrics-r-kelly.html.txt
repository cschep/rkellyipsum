Baby, is it all right if I break it down
And give you something romantic?
I figured since it's raining
This would be the perfect time for us
Can you hear the sounds of the Love angels calling us? Sweet violins and harps
playing Then suddenly there's this kiss of trust
Dapper than the morning dew Tonight has chosen me and you And girl I vow to
make everyone Of your fantasies come true
I can hear, horns sounding, bells ringing A full orchestra and a choir singing
The oceans calm and the rivers flowing It feels so good, keep on going
Raindrops keep falling on our heads, as we make love We won't stop, the rain
keeps falling down on both of us Raindrops keep falling on our heads, as we
make love We won't stop, the rain keeps falling down on both of us
Can you see the flowers blooming Slowly as the seasons change The gift of joy
is founded When I softly hear you call my name
Rose petals and all these oils Surrounded by 100 candles An eagle delivers a
letter that says The night will last forever
Dapper than the morning dew Tonight has chosen me and you And girl I promise to
make everyone Of your fantasies come true
I can hear, horns sounding, bells ringing A full orchestra and a choir singing
The oceans calm and the rivers flowing Don't you stop, keep on going
Raindrops keep falling on our heads, as we make love We won't stop, the rain
keeps falling down, on both of us Raindrops keep falling on our heads, as we
make love We won't stop, the rain keeps falling down, on both of us
Through all the trees, the smooth wind blows Then suddenly a rainbow And an
ocean filled with white sailboats And huge waterfalls that overflow
See those in well are fairy tales I will buck for love And imagine far away
from here in a land Where the sky cries joyful tears
Baby, another words Will you marry me?
