I wish, I wish, I wish<br>
To every city<br>
I wish, I wish, I wish<br>
Every hood<br>
I wish, I wish, I wish<br>
And every block<br>
I wish, I wish, I wish<br>
Ghetto America!<br>
<br>
Rollin' through the hood<br>
Just stopped by to say what's up<br>
And let you know<br>
That your baby boy ain't doing so tough<br>
And even though you passed<br>
Going on four long years<br>
Still waking up late at night crying tears<br>
Just thinking about those days<br>
You used to talk to me<br>
Smilin' while I'm sippin' on this Hennesy<br>
And remember we bragged on how rich we would be<br>
To get up out this hood was like a fantasy<br>
<br>
<i>[1]</i><br>
And now you hear my songs the radio is playin'<br>
Oh I can't believe my ears<br>
And what everybody's sayin'<br>
And boy I'll tell you<br>
Folks don't know the half<br>
I would give it all up<br>
Just to take one ride<br>
<br>
(With you)<br>
How I used to kick it on the front porch<br>
(With you)<br>
And how I used to lay back and smoke weed<br>
(With you)<br>
And all the little basement party joints we'd do<br>
Now I'm just missing you<br>
How I wish<br>
<br>
<i>[2]</i><br>
I wish that I could hold you now<br>
I wish that I could touch you now<br>
I wish that I could talk to you<br>
Be with you somehow<br>
I know you're in a better place<br>
Even though I can't see your face<br>
I know you're smiling down on me<br>
Saying everything's okay<br>
And if I make it out this thug life<br>
I'll see you again someday<br>
I wish, I wish, I wish<br>
I wish, I wish, I wish<br>
<br>
Now ever since this money come<br>
Been nothing but stress<br>
Sometimes I wish I could trade in my success<br>
Y'all look at me and say boy you've been blessed<br>
But y'all don't see the inside of my unhappiness<br>
Man I swear this shit gets heavy like a ton<br>
That's why you hear me shootin'<br>
This real shit off like a gun<br>
Hmm I wonder how my friends would treat me now<br>
If I wasn't iced up with a Bentley and a house<br>
That's why fake ass niggas get fake ass digits<br>
And fake ass players get a real player hatin' 'em<br>
Honey Love goes platinum and y'all ass come around<br>
But y'all don't wanna raise the roof<br>
Until my shit is going down<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
(With you)<br>
How I used to hoop off in them tournaments<br>
(With you)<br>
And how I used to club hop on weekends<br>
(With you)<br>
Your family called the morning of the tragic end<br>
Damn, my condolensces<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 2]</i><br>
<br>
Voices in my head be telling me to come to church<br>
Saying the Lord is the only way for you to stop the hurt<br>
Dreaming of windows black tinted like a hearse<br>
When waking up to life sometimes seems worst<br>
And all I ever wanted is to be a better man<br>
And I try to keep it real with my homies land<br>
For me to save the world I don't understand<br>
How did I become the leader of a billion fans?<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
(With you)<br>
How I used to street perform on Friday<br>
(With you)<br>
And how I used to go to church on Easter Sunday<br>
(With you)<br>
Instead of you all throwing them stones at me<br>
Somebody pray for me<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 2 till end]</i>
