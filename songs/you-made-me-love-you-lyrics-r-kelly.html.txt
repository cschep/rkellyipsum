The power of love, the power of love
Listen, said I, said I didn't, said I didn't
Said I didn't want to fall in love, oh oh oh
The power of love y'all
Anybody anybody anybody Anybody anybody anybody Anybody anybody anybody
Listen, I was just minding my business when Ms. Purdy you came walking My heart
stopped said what is this just As soon as you started talking
Something happened deep within me All of a sudden I got this feeling When a
chill came from feet to head and then I Turned away from you and said to myself

"This is not supposed to happen, brother You've been hurt too many times before
First I tripped, then I slipped, then I fell"
You made me love you, babe, made me love you, babe Made me love you, babe, made
me love you, babe You made me love you, babe, made me love you, babe Made me
love you, babe, made me love you, babe You made me love you, babe, made me love
you, babe Made me love you, babe, made me love you, babe
Said you must be one of them top models Body curved like a pop bottle Got me
sweating like a boxer, baby I done stumbled up on a perfect lady
Could this be what heaven sent to me An angel come to set me free Love has been
a stranger to me And myself keeps telling me that
"This is not supposed to happen, brother You've been hurt too many times before
First I tripped, then I slipped, then I fell"
You made me love you, babe, made me love you, babe Made me love you, babe, made
me love you, babe You made me love you, babe, made me love you, babe Made me
love you, babe, made me love you, babe You made me love you, babe, made me love
you, babe Made me love you, babe, made me love you, babe
Said the power of love, you see Are 10 billion wonders to me like the moon and
stars above There's a whole new world for my eyes to see, yes sir So much joy,
darling you put in me
And now the sun is shining Where there used to be rain, oh Lord And now no more
loneliness No more hurt, no more pain You made, you made me love you
You made me love you, babe, made me love you, babe Made me love you, babe, made
me love you, babe You made me love you, babe, made me love you, babe Made me
love you, babe, made me love you, babe You made me love you, babe, made me love
you, babe Made me love you, babe, made me love you, babe ...
