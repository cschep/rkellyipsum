I can see my destination , I can hear my call<br>
No more hesitation this time I'm going for all<br>
Cause I know where this road leads to and therefore I will rise,<br>
I know this dream will come true, an I will soar the sky<br>
<br>
Spirit spirit would you guide me<br>
Spirit spirit stand by me<br>
C'mon and c'mon and c'mon and <br>
set me free<br>
<br>
I can feel the penetration, of a strong wind moving me<br>
I can feel the elevation, of an angel lifting me,<br>
Cause i know where this road leads to and therefore I will rise<br>
I know this dream will come true, an I will soar the sky<br>
<br>
Spirit spirit would you guide me<br>
oh oh Spirit spirit standing by me<br>
C'mon and c'mon and c'mon and <br>
set me free<br>
<br>
Whoa whoa spirit<br>
Now that I found my way home<br>
I'm gotta get there get there<br>
No one step seems more miles long<br>
No bridge before my face, I will take the leap of faith<br>
<br>
Spirit spirit would you guide me<br>
Spirit spirit stand by me<br>
Spirit spirit Set me free<br>
Spirit spirit Spirit spirit spirit Set me free<br>
Spirit come and find my way spirit stand by my side<br>
Spirit take my hand and be my guide<br>
Spirit run free spirit run free run free run free spirit run free
