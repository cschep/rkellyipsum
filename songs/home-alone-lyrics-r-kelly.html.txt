It's gonna be a party y'all
Keith Murray rocks, wide and universal and most come
Combine with R. Kelly and prove it can be done
Non-stoppin', Def squad and Rockland
I here somebody knockin', yo, R the party's startin'
Step into the crib with me tonight Kelly's in the mood to make it right Word is
gettin' all over town The party's over here and gettin' down, yeah
Hands in the air, drinks everywhere Party in the hills, keepin' it real Guests
from out of town, ladies all around Me and the crew, doin' what we do
Beat is bangin' up and down your spine And all the single women here are fine
Let your body give into your soul Release the freak and you will lose control
Girl, there's a party goin' on, my temperature's warm So let me freak you to
the floor, while the bass is thumpin' All night if your body can handle it
Hands in the air, drinks everywhere Party in the hills, keepin' it real Guests
from out of town, ladies all around Me and the crew, doin' what we do
Chillin' at the house on the hill We gotta sing my, my, my, like Johnny Gill
Rich girl, poor girl get the same respect You can all drink for free and call
Earl collect
At the moment of truth with burden of proof We stacks the stuff and spread love
like it's used The lyrical genius with R&B messiah And the roof, the roof, we
sets on fire
But as long as the party is jumpin', we ain't concerned We don't need no water
let the motherfucker burn And everybody knew somebody who was there With they
hands in the air bringin' in the New Year Yeah, ay, yo, come on
Nuggets on the wrist, it's just the shine 'Cause ain't nobody checkin' out the
time Cash and clothes for days to blow your mind Maybe it's all good so there's
tonight
Girl, there's a party goin' on, my temperature's warm So let me freak you to
the floor, while the bass is thumpin' All night if your body can handle it
All we want is a party, a reason to celebrate Now that we got the money, we
dance the night away Nothing but the hands up
Hands in the air, drinks everywhere Party in the hills, keepin' it real Guests
from out of town, ladies all around Me and the crew, doin' what we do
Hands in the air, drinks everywhere Party in the hills, keepin' it real Guests
from out of town, ladies all around Me and the crew, doin' what we do
Hands in the air, drinks everywhere Party in the hills, keepin' it real Guests
from out of town, ladies all around Me and the crew, doin' what we do
Hands in the air, drinks everywhere Party in the hills, keepin' it real Guests
from out of town, ladies all around Me and the crew, doin' what we do
Hands in the air, drinks everywhere Party in the hills, keepin' it real Guests
from out of town, ladies all around Me and the crew, doin' what we do
Hands in the air, drinks everywhere Party in the hills, keepin' it real Guests
from out of town, ladies all around Come on, come on, come on, come on Put your
hands up, come on, come on
