Merry Christmas
To all of the world
Hearing the bells go ding dong
Hearing the choir sing songs
Letting us know it's Christmas Time for the world to spread love
I open my eyes And to my surprise I've come to realize that
All around the world it's Christmas All around the world it's Christmas All
around the world it's Christmas And I'm so glad to be Sharing peace and harmony
with you
Looking out of the window Seeing the winter white snow Kiss under the mistletoe
I see the angel's halo
I open my eyes And to my surprise I've come to realize that
All around the world it's Christmas All around the world it's Christmas All
around the world it's Christmas And I'm so glad to be Sharing peace and harmony
with you
So, come on, come on A Child is born Onto us, a King
So, joy to the world Women, men, boy and girl For with this love and Christmas
brings
All around the world it's Christmas All around the world it's Christmas All
around the world it's Christmas And I'm so glad to be Sharing peace and harmony
with you
All around the world it's Christmas All around the world it's Christmas All
around the world it's Christmas And I'm so glad to be Sharing peace and harmony
with you
All around the world it's Christmas All around the world it's Christmas All
around the world it's Christmas And I'm so glad to be Sharing peace and harmony
with you
All around the world it's Christmas All around the world it's Christmas All
around the world it's Christmas And I'm so glad to be Sharing peace and harmony
with you
