Big chips, we off in Vegas, drinkin' an' partyin'
We got chicks in swimsuits modelin'
We in them twin stretch Maybachs, dippin' low
The way the wrist shine, it's so magical
You know them boys got the clubs out of control Nigga, fuck what ya heard, it's
Kells an' Hov With the second comin' of 'Best of both' In the first week, I
predict a million sold, we talkin'
Big chips, big trips to Vegas, nigga Big cribs an' the whips is spacious Any
day they could dig your grave Shit, So Big is my inspiration, dig?
No reward, that's the risk is taken In which case you niggaz wouldn't wanna
switch places I, on the other hand relish the situation Thank the Lord for the
gift, I'm gracious
I went overboard, look at this big bracelet I overhauled it, you wouldn't
recognize it From the time that I bought it, I just replaced it I risk cases
for shit like this, nigga I pray for some shit like this
Word to my Uncle Ray Who gave us life for some shit like this Ma, you rollin',
I'm as real as it gets
Big chips, we off in Vegas, drinkin' an' partyin' We got chicks in swimsuits
modelin' We in them twin stretch Maybachs, dippin low The way the wrist shine,
it's so magical
You know them boys got the clubs out of control Nigga, fuck what ya heard, it's
Kells an' Hov With the second comin' of 'Best of both' In the first week, I
predict a million sold, we talkin'
Big chips, I can't take this The way you move your ass slow like Matrix You
make me wanna toss chips in Vegas Before I toss chips first, get naked
I can't fake it Girl, you got the club shut down when you freak it Superstar,
honey, so mean an' vicious Got a lot an' comin', I'm so mean an' vicious
Bark, bark farmer, this chicken layin' platinum, ex-farmer So go low, mama,
give it a go As I punch 170 on stretch roads, must turn up the radio Girl, you
so good, I'm swervin' like, Whoa, whoa
From the club to the stretch Out the stretch to the Hotel Into the hotel suite
Big chips, we off in Vegas, drinkin' an' partyin' We got chicks in swimsuits
modelin' We in them twin stretch Maybachs, dippin low The way the wrist shine,
it's so magical
You know them boys got the clubs out of control Nigga, fuck what ya heard, it's
Kells an' Hov With the second comin' of 'Best of both' In the first week, I
predict a million sold, we talkin'
Big chips, I'm a boss, I said Tilt my hat an' I cross my legs Like old ladies
at the park, I toss my bread An' the pigeons start flockin', ballin' like
Bishop Loughlin
An' stick Cochran on any D.A. to try to stop him So any gunplay that is a
option I been doin' this since niggaz was woppin' Rockin' Izods with the
matchin' socks an' Slap boxin' in the back park an' when the girls start
watchin' They try to get real, you had to drop 'em
See, I ain't never been a fronter Or fake it 'til I make it tight, nigga Ma, I
don't want ya number, either you're comin' or I one ya Either you know what you
want, ma, I don't even want ya You play pretty if you wanna
Big chips, we off in Vegas, drinkin' an' partyin' We got chicks in swimsuits

it's so magical

Kells an' Hov With the second comin' of 'Best of both' In the first week, I
predict a million sold, we talkin' big chips
All around the world, stop where the sun sets Spendin' big chips you wanna go,
you wanna go Say we goin' around the world, stop where the sun sets Spendin'
big chips you wanna go, do you wanna go?
Come on, Tone, I see ya Jigga, Kells, yeah, Track Masters, what's really good?
We in the Islands, chillin' in the shade an' shit You know, blue waters, yellow
sand Either I'm high or I think I just saw a dolphin
What you drinkin', J? Me, myself, I'm drinkin' on this lemonade Mixed with
some, I dunno what this shit is But it got me real nice right now
Tone, fade this track Goodnight
