Yo, for those who live the way that I live<br>
We came a long way<br>
From wiping coal outta eyelids, to rap's hottest<br>
Fake Gazelles to black Pradas<br>
Selling nicks to trey bags, to making hits like Kidada Jones' father<br>
OG's would send me to the store with a dollar<br>
Hit me with some wise advice for me to follow<br>
Ain't nothing free in the world in life <br>
No matter who you are, everybody got they price<br>
And some cost more than other's<br>
When you poor, it's like life ain't even worth living<br>
But when you rich, it's every fat ass worth hittin'<br>
With no chips, your drawers just stay on your hips<br>
I play with the six cuz money make the whole world spin<br>
But without the Franklin faces, you see who's your real friends<br>
It's V-12's, honeys on the cell, bobbin' out the JBL<br>
It's Nas and R. Kell<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br>
Never thought that I'd ever live this life<br>
Money stacked in rolls, honeys on each side<br>
Anything I want, I can say it's mine<br>
No more worries Â¡Rbout how can I provide<br>
