It's the boy Jay-Z and the boy R. Kel, the best of both worlds
Please believe it, Brookland, Chi-town, to all the beautiful ladies
In the world, dedicated to TT, my niece, everybody in the world
Talk to 'em Kel, that's right, tone, this is mean and vicious man
So mean and vicious, rockland, roc-a-fella, the best of both worlds Come on
Lord forgive me, I'm ballin' out of control Got the spirit of a hustler pouring
out of my soul Mami I love you but ain't no stopping my stroll If you wanna be
down with me, you gotta roll
Like a roll and if my side of the bed gets cold You gotta know that I'm out,
chasin' dough I'm ain't stunting these hoes, stunting my growth If I fuck 'em
I'm fleeing them, I need something to hold
Then I'm home to you, I might roam like a cellular phone But I never leave you
alone I solemnly swear I was married to the block before I met you It's still a
part of me there but I solemnly swear
I try but it's in my blood pumping, yay Since I was yay high, I'm in love with
the life So except me for the bastard that I am You're still in love with me
right?
Baby, I can't figure it out Said, you pussy, tastes like honey But I can't stop
huggin' the block All night tryna get this money
Stuck between these two worlds What I'm gonna do with both these girls? Two
main squeezes in separate cities Both found out man, shit ain't pretty
Stuck between these two worlds What I'm gonna do with both these girls Hard to
choose between her and these streets 'Cuz the game keeps calling me
Baby girl, had me off my grind, off my clock, I would often find I was off my
block, couldn't keep her off my mind My balls were shot, they never thought
that a pause or stop Was in my pores to push rock raw, take a lost rebound like
Bo Outlaw
I'm so outlaw, got a hunger for this game But keep that on the low like a one
against the grain Got the sun against my brain, a girl in my ear, I like her
for her I'm a dig into this shit, I like it like I like her
Sometimes, I can't figure it out, I'm in love with the life But she's sticking
it out, she know wanna hug kisses keep A nigga in the house, lock down while
his niggas is out
Baby, I can't figure it out Said, you pussy, tastes like honey But I can't stop
huggin' the block All night tryna get this money
Baby, I can't figure it out Said, you pussy, tastes like honey But I can't stop
huggin' the block All night tryna get this money
