Good about our loving darling, listen
Like the world goes around every day, baby
That is how you spin me Might as well call me a telegram, baby 'Cause darling,
that's just how you send me, yeah
I might as well take me a pen and sign a waiver To be yours for the rest of my
life, oh baby You rescued me from heartache just like a savior Now being in
your arms is my paradise
Listen baby Ain't no love like your love, ain't no kiss like your kiss Felt a
whole lot of things but nothing's ever felt like this You a genie to me, babe,
the way you grant my wish And tonight we're gonna let the world hear it
This is how our love is You and me forever, baby, sing it, darling Oh, this is
how our love is Can't nobody come between it, nah, babe
Listen honey Ain't no doubt what we got, baby, is one of a kind We're in the
hall of fame as the greatest love of all time So many said that this love
wouldn't last too long But we got the victory, darling and proved them all
wrong
Just like the sun comes in and chased away the rain, oh girl See I love you,
boy, 'cause you take away my pain And it don't matter where you are, just call
me, baby 'Cause I'd run a million miles just to get to you, baby
Listen honey, now Ain't no love like your love ain't no kiss like your kiss
Felt a whole lot of things but nothing's ever felt like this You a genie to me,
babe, the way you grant my wish And tonight we're gonna let the world hear it
This is how our love is You and me forever, baby, sing it to me, darling Girl,
this is how our love is Ain't nobody come between us, babe
Now let me tell you how I feel See our love is like an antidote and we deliver
Whole wide world with it, darling, preach to me
This love is like the people's hope Something outta heaven, baby, 'cause it's
gotta colon Oh girl, when we're touching, ooh, when we're feeling It's crazy
like walking on the ceiling
This is how our love is, baby, you and me You and me sing it to me, girl Oh,
this is how our love is, baby And can't nobody come between us, baby
This is how our love is, rain, sleet or snow Oh baby, I want the whole wide
world to know This is how our love is, forever and a day, hey It will always be
this way
This is how our love is, take it or leave it You and me together, take it or
leave it This is how our love is, take it or leave it Take it or leave it, this
is how our love is
