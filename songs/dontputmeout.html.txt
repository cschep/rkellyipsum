Baby now I realize <br>
All of those times I told you I loved you<br>
I just didn't show it<br>
I'm sorry<br>
<br>
Don't put me out<br>
Don't put me out<br>
Don't put me out<br>
Don't put me out<br>
Don't put me out<br>
Don't put me out<br>
Don't put me out<br>
Don't put me out<br>
Don't put me out<br>
Don't put me out<br>
<br>
I remember when you said to me<br>
Don't talk about it be about it<br>
I should have felt you when you said<br>
To me that you were all alone<br>
I act like I was doin' a favor<br>
For you cuz you were wit me<br>
Something let me thinking that whatever happens<br>
This would be my home<br>
But I was wrong (I was wrong)<br>
How could I have been so low<br>
(How could i have been so low)<br>
I wrote a song all about it<br>
(Took a pen and wrote a song)<br>
Wanna hear it, here it go, from now on<br>
<br>
<i>[1]</i> - I won't talk about lovin' you<br>
Cuz I'm gonna be about lovin' you<br>
I won't talk about comin' home<br>
Cuz I'm gonna be about comin' home<br>
I won't talk about both of us<br>
Cuz I'm gonna be about both of us<br>
I won't talk about makin' sweet love<br>
Cuz I'm gonna be about makin' sweet love<br>
<br>
Now I remember when we used the crib in Studio 12A<br>
Clothes and pallets on the floor makin' sweet love night till day<br>
Used to say I wanna have a baby boy and call him Man<br>
But now it's all gone up in smoke and baby I don't understand<br>
All I know that is I was wrong<br>
(Dead wrong, yeah)<br>
How could I have stooped so low<br>
(How could I have stooped so low)<br>
I wrote a song about it<br>
(Wrote a song)<br>
Wrote about it, here it go, from now on<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
Now all the money in the world couldn't add up to what you did<br>
Cuz when I was down and out you took the burden off of me<br>
I never thoguht that when I took her out somehow it'd cause me pain<br>
I was rooming at the Drake, how the hell you found my name<br>
Damn I was wrong (I was wrong)<br>
How could I have stooped so low<br>
(How could I have stooped so low)<br>
I wrote a song, yeah<br>
All about it, here it go, from now on<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
I won't talk about lovin' you<br>
Cuz I'm gonna be about lovin' you<br>
<br>
Girl, open up the door and let me in this house, please baby<br>
I'm tired of banging on this door the neighbors say I'm loud<br>
Honey, I beg of you <br>
<br>
Don't put me out<br>
Don't put me out<br>
Don't put me out<br>
Don't put me out<br>
Don't put me out<br>
Don't put me out<br>
Don't put me out<br>
Don't put me out<br>
Don't put me out<br>
Don't put me out
