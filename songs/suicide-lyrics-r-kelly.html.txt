Said the easiest thing in the world
Is to love you
And the hardest thing in the world
Is to lose you
Said I tried and tried again to keep you But it just ain't no use
I'm baffled 'cuz of what went down See I got your letter so you're leavin' town
Just take one minute to think about Baby, let's back track on what happened in
this house
Now I remember clearly it was a Saturday I came walkin' in, four o'clock in the
mornin' And I thought you were sleepin', one eye open You turned and said to me
where the hell you been
Then I turned it around and hollered With some friends drinkin' And now I'm
sittin' here all alone Wishing you were here to house this home, oh
Say the easiest thing in the world Is to love you But the hardest thing in the
world Is to lose you
And now I'm sitting here sippin' on things I'm not suppose to And that ain't
cool I've got to get over losing you
Shattered, can't believe you're gone I'm left in the middle of these four walls
Lyin' helpless, 'bout to lose my mind, baby I can't fathom life without you by
my side
Now every night before I go to sleep I pray to heaven for a better me Nights
I'm up thinkin' and days I'm up dreamin' You were at work, I was at play
A nigga wanted you and plus his cake I know I ain't got no right to say But I
need you to head on back this way Because I'm sittin' here all alone Wishing
you were here to house this home
Say the easiest thing in the world Is to love you And the hardest thing in the
world Is to lose you
And now I'm sitting here sippin' on things That I'm not suppose to And woman
you know that ain't cool I've got to get over Baby can't we just moan for love
Like we used to
Say the easiest thing in the world Is to love you But the hardest thing in the
world Is to lose you
So I'm sitting here sippin' on things That I'm not suppose to Contemplating,
you know that ain't cool That ain't cool, ain't right mama But I just can't
seem to get over
See, sometimes we men, we can dish it out But sometimes we men, we can't take
it and hey So I'm gonna get up out this chair And catch me a train and get
where you are, hey
Because I love you baby And I need you right here by my side Ghetto woman, come
on home to me I'm dyin' sorry and I can't seem to break free
