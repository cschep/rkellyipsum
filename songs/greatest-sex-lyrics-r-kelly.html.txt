From beyond this bed of mine, I see
Ceiling fans with you on top of me
And the window blinds are filled with rays of sun
And all your secret fantasies, thy will be done, done
And inside of your walls there will dwell a Capricorn That will feast your body
all night And if keep this up then our love child will be born All because of
the greatest
The greatest you, the greatest me We have found, the greatest chemistry The
greatest touch, the greatest kiss What came to be, is the greatest wish
The greatest show, the greatest song The greatest words, the greatest all night
long Baby your love stays constantly on my mind This is the best sex I've ever
had
I know twelve ways to make your love come down And the secret places on you
will be found Like a voyage when the storm begins to roar There's no telling
what this night could have in store, store
'Cause inside of your walls there will dwell a Capricorn That will feast your
body all night And if we keep this up then our love child will be born All
because of the greatest
The greatest you, the greatest me We have found, the greatest chemistry The
greatest touch, the greatest kiss What came to be, is the greatest wish
The greatest show, the greatest song The greatest words, the greatest all night
long Baby your love stays constantly on my mind This is the best sex I've ever
had
The greatest you, the greatest me We have found, the greatest chemistry The
greatest touch, the greatest kiss What came to be, is the greatest wish
The greatest show, the greatest song The greatest words, the greatest all night
long Baby your love stays constantly on my mind It's the greatest sex I ever
had, yeah, yeah
The greatest you, the greatest me We have found, the greatest chemistry The
greatest touch, the greatest kiss What came to be, is the greatest wish
The greatest show, the greatest song The greatest words, the greatest all night
long Baby your love stays constantly on my mind This sex's so good, I've got to
break it down
