<br>
Come on in this house children<br>
The war has started<br>
Light the candles right now<br>
It's about to be darkness, oh yeah<br>
There's no telling when the sun will shine again, no<br>
When it's over there's a question asked<br>
Who wins? Who wins?<br>
<br>
Spirit<br>
Through the land<br>
Spirit of peace<br>
Oh yes<br>
Spirit move<br>

(Peace) hurry<br>
<br>
Turn your head, close your eyes<br>
There's people out there dying, oh<br>
With so much wealth in the land<br>
Why is this land starving?<br>
As I look over this place<br>
There's so much hatred<br>
If I could I'd pack my bags<br>
And hitch hike to heaven<br>
<br>
Spirit move<br>
Oh move<br>
Spirit move<br>
All through the land<br>
Won't you move<br>
Oh move, oh move, oh move<br>
Oh move, yeah<br>
This is what I prayer for<br>

(Peace) for peace<br>
