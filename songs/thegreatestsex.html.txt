From beyond this bed of mine I see<br>
Ceiling fans with you on top of me<br>
And the window blinds are filled with rays of sun<br>
And all you secret fantasies thy will be done (done)<br>
And inside of your walls there will dwell a Capricorn <br>
(that will feast your body all night)<br>
If we keep this up then a love child will be born<br>
All because<br>
Of the greatest<br>
<br>
<i>[chorus]</i><br>
The greatest you<br>
The greatest me<br>
We have found the greatest chemistry<br>
The greatest touch <br>
The greatest kiss<br>
What came to be is the greatest wish<br>
The greatest show<br>
The greatest song<br>
The greatest words<br>
The greatest all night long <br>
Baby your love stays constantly on my mind<br>
This is the best sex I've ever had<br>
<br>
I know twelve ways to make your love come down<br>
And the secret places on you will be found<br>
Like a voyage when the storm begins to roar <br>
There's no telling what this night could have in store (in store)<br>
Cause inside of your walls there will dwell a capricorn <br>
(that will feast your body all night)<br>
And if we keep this up then a love child will be born<br>
All because<br>
Of the greatest<br>
<br>
<i>[chorus]</i><br>
The greatest you<br>
The greatest me<br>
We have found the greatest chemistry<br>
The greatest touch <br>
The greatest kiss<br>
What came to be is the greatest wish<br>
The greatest show<br>
The greatest song<br>
The greatest words<br>
The greatest all night long <br>
Baby your love stays constantly on my mind<br>
This is the best sex I've ever had<br>
<i>[repeat 3x]</i><br>
<br>
Something heaven has ordained for the sake of our love<br>
Like a hand and glove we go together this love is forever oooh<br>
<br>
This sex is so good I've got to break it down
