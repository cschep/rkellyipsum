You remind me of something<br>
I just can't think of what it is<br>
<br>
<i>[1]</i> - You remind me of my jeep, I wanna ride it<br>
Something like my sound, I wanna pump it<br>
Girl you look just like my cars, I wanna wax it<br>
And something like my bank account<br>
I wanna spend it, baby<br>
<br>
It's something about your love that's got me going crazy<br>
Baby, you know I want you real bad<br>
And girl I really like your freaky style<br>
How can I be down with you?<br>
So get a little closer to my ride<br>
I wanna get to know you lady<br>
And hip me up on how to get inside you<br>
Listen, pretty baby<br>
<br>
<i>[2]</i> - I wanna roll it, roll it, roll it, roll it<br>
Is all I wanna do for you baby<br>
Girl, it's something kind of sexy<br>
Goin' on about you babe<br>
<i>[repeat 1, 1]</i><br>
<br>
Now I would like to take you on a ride tonight<br>
Girl, you know we'll have so much fun<br>
And give you everything your body needs<br>
Satisfaction guaranteed<br>
So pull up to my bumper and let the system sound<br>
Girl, I bet cha' I can drive you crazy<br>
And let me be the one to drop you off<br>
Babe, listen to me<br>
<i>[rpt 2, 1, 1...1]</i><br>
<br>
Don't be alone, don't be alone<br>
I'm comin' through your door<br>
Turn off the lights, turn off the lights, baby<br>
It's something about this moment<br>
<i>[rpt 1, 1, 1...]</i>
