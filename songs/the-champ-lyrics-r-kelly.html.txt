Hey, hey
Ladies and gentlemen
The champ is here
The champ is here
The champ is here Get your mutha****** hands in the air
The champ is here The champ is here The champ is here You can hate me I don't
care
All y'all wanna pile on me Make it hard for me to breathe Throw sand in my eyes
And make it hard for me to see
Out of breath Can't see Still hard to defeat The history that I make Impossible
to repeat
Spread rumors Point fingers Throw stones Judge me
Hate me Love me Hug me Curse me
Whatever 'Cause y'all f*****' opinions don't feed me I'm clever And nothin'
know that the industry needs me
(Second round!) I'm opposite of the demon that faces me I've been through hell
Lived in the belly of the beast
I confess my sins But still didn't find peace But like MJ and five I will six
peak
(Third round!) I make music for hood first 'Cause that's where Im from That's
why the hood is always first To help me overcome
(Fifth round!) When Im down some o' y'all cats Act so strange And when Im up
same cats wonder Why I act so strange
(Sixth round!) Kells ain't change Please you b****** is so lame Somethin' ain't
y'all fault Then y'all so quick to blame
That's why I got number one On the back o' my Range Y'all cats is foreplayin'
I'm pregnant by the game
(Seventh round!) Some would like to see me in ball and chain But Im a child of
god So my destiny's ordained
(Eighth round!) Undisputed is the title I claim 'Bout to shoot the world up
With this lyrical cocaine
(Ninth round!) The place is packed The bell rings I'm about to bring the pain
Left jab Right hook Shuttin' down yo' brain
(Tenth round!) I could be surrounded by lions In the midst of the jungle And
still Im a rumble (Ladies and gentlemen) Young man rumble
(Eleventh round!) The champ is here The champ is here The champ is here Get
your mutha******' hands in the air
The champ is here The champ is here The champ is here You can hate me I don't
care
