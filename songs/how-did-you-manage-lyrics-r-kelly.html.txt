Ooh mmm, ooh yeah
Ooh mmm mmm mmm mmm
Ooh mmm, ooh uhh
Ooh uh uh uh uh
You made the sun You made the moon Gave seasons change
You made the clouds You put the rainbow After the rain
Created time Now which one's mine Gave pictures frames
Created man Gave him woman Why did You do that for me?
These are the questions asked Before I lay me down and go to sleep Sometimes I
wonder why you decided To keep Your hands on me
Of all the miracles, signs and wonders There's still one mystery How did You
manage to love me?
You breathe the life Right into me Then made my heart beat
Created the mountains All of the deep seas Flowers and the trees
You made tomorrow Come again You calm the strong winds
After all I've done You gave me a son Tell me why would You do that for me?
These are the questions asked Before I lay me down and go to sleep Sometimes I
wonder why You decided To keep Your hands on me
Of all the miracles, signs and wonders There's still one mystery How did You
manage to love me? How did You manage to love me?
Said, "I've got to know how" After all the wrong I've done, oh Lord, how? After
I've been so bad, oh Lord, how? Even when I didn't believe in me, you believed
in me Lord, how?
Jesus, You sacrificed Your great life for me Ooh Lord, tell me Ooh, You, oh
why?
