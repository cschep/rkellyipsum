Many lovers has come, and<br>
Many lovers have gone.<br>
Similar to an old fashion song<br>
(A thousand years from now<br>
We'll be still putting it down my baby.)<br>
<br>
You can change the frame, <br>
But the picture remains the same.<br>
Similar to the sun after the rain.<br>
(Thousand years from now, we'll<br>
Be still puttin' it down my baby)<br>
<br>
Baby girl in other words for ever more<br>
I'll be here. (I'll be here).<br>

Some have cross the finish line and some gave up.<br>
It's like moving a mountain <br>
Love can be just that tough yeah.<br>
