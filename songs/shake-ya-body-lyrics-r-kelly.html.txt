We got honies everywhere Corks off the Cris' poppin' everywhere Partyin' hard
like we just don't care The best of both worlds, that shit ain't fair
This shit ain't fair, I am Jay, hov' Mami shake ya body body, don't hurt nobody
hottie It's me in the god-body, R. Kelly, the John Gotti Of R&B thug and me I
would say I'm probably
The hardest rapper to ever cop on poppy and put it in a song Ma how could you
go wrong? Ha ha ha ha worse than a armed robbery Know that I'm armed properly,
whenever the arm's rocky
You can go on clockin' me, ain't nuttin' gon' stop me High as Allah I be,
movin' in peace but I Move with the piece, so them, dudes in the streets Will
never remove my piece, ha ha, got me
Niggaz'll never get me, I never move sloppy Move with the Glock 50, got some
Tupac with me Let's not test my gangsta, just, raise your glasses Mami, shake
ya asses, this is a thug classic
Make a hole, make a hole and let the queen come past I come through in the
speedboat, with 808's in the glass Push big things here, bet most of y'all
crash Back to trainin' lightweights, you in the wrong weight class
Haters, stay awake, fuck the Harlem shake We 'Slam' dance like onyx, check my
Ebonics You got, heat nigga you thinkin' we won't blaze? Gotta come hard 'cause
these are the last days
When I do it I do's it, ain't no more to it Ask Ice Cube I puts my back into it
From car dealers to Macy's, the cashiers embrace me We train like the Navy for
whatever the case may be
I pass on the 6, they don't impress me much I want the bulletproof 7 'cause the
doors lift up They pick the best of all girls, so how y'all sound? I got the
best of both worlds, holdin' me down
Uh-huh (Shake ya body body, move ya body body) Uh-huh (Twist ya body body,
switch ya body body)
Uh-huh (Dip ya body body, work ya body body) Uh-huh (Anybody body, everybody
body)
Uh-huh
