I'm lookin' over the skyline of the city
How loud quiet nights in the mist of crime
How next door to happiness lives sorrow
And signals of solution in the sky
A city of justice, a city of love, a city of peace For everyone of us We all
need it, can't live without it A Gotham City, oh yeah
How sleepin' awake because of fear (Oh yeah) How children are drowning in their
tears How we need a place where we can go A land where every one will have a
hero (Even me)
A city of justice, a city of love, a city of peace For everyone of us 'Cause we
all need it, yeah, can't live without it A Gotham City, oh yeah
A city of justice, a city of love, a city of peace For everyone of us 'Cause we
all need it, can't live without it A Gotham City, oh yeah
Yet in the middle of stormy weather We won't stumble and we won't fall I know a
place that all this shelter
City of justice, city of love, city of peace For everyone of us We all need it,
can't live without it Gotham City, oh yeah
We need a city of justice, city of love, city of peace For everyone of us We
all need it, can't live without it Gotham City, oh yeah
City of justice, city of love, city of peace For everyone of us Yes, we all
need it, can't live without it Gotham City, oh yeah
A Gotham City (Everybody needs Gotham City) Gotham City (Don't you want one, oh
yeah)
Come on, come on, Gotham City (Everybody needs Gotham City) A Gotham City
(Don't you want one, oh yeah)
Children sing
A Gotham City A Gotham City A Gotham City ...
