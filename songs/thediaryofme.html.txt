Umm pum-pum-pum<br>
Pum-pum, pum-pum, pum-pum<br>
<br>
Look behind myself<br>
As I reflect on all the memories<br>
The times they come and go<br>
Lost everything from friends to Family<br>
If I could turn back the hands<br>
There would be some things I'd change about me<br>
I know that my past is not what my future holds<br>
<br>
Where I come from<br>
Who could believe<br>
All the pain and misery<br>
Look in my eyes and you'll see<br>
The diary of me<br>
<br>
Rewind my life<br>
Just go back and correct all the wrong<br>
And ask God to direct my path<br>
So that I can make it home<br>
And if I could turn back the hands of time<br>
There would be some things I would change about me<br>
But I know that my past is not what my future holds<br>
'Cause<br>
<br>
Where I'm from<br>
Who could believe<br>
All the pain, misery<br>
Look in my eyes and you will see<br>
The diary of me<br>
<br>
Years ago a child was born (a child was born) (ooh)<br>
And raised without a man (without my... father, and wonder why he's in these streets) (ooh)<br>
<br>
My mother's gone (mothers gone, yet still... found the strength to pray for me) (ooh)<br>
But still reached out her hand<br>
Just open the book (na-na-na-na-na-na)<br>
Turn the pages of my life (na-na-na)<br>
And you will read<br>
A true story about one man's journey<br>
<br>
Where I'm from (ahh...)<br>
Who would believe, yeah<br>
That all the hurt and pain and misery (ahh...)<br>
Look in my eyes (ahh...)<br>
You'll see the diary of me (pum-pum-pum-pum-pum)<br>
Where I'm from (where I'm from, who could believe) (ahh...)<br>
Who could believe (the hurt and pain and misery)<br>
(Look in my eyes) in my eyes (and you will see) (ahh...)<br>
(The makings of) the makings of<br>
(My diary) my diary<br>
(Where I'm from) look in my eyes (ahh...)<br>
(Who could believe) you'll see<br>
(The hurt and pain and misery)<br>
(Look in my eyes) (ahh...)<br>
(And you will see) yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah<br>
(The makings of my diary)<br>
(Where I'm from...) (ahh...)
