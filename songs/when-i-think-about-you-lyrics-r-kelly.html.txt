When I wake up in the morning time and see the sun I say
Hallelujah, thank you Jesus for waking me up today
I think about His goodness and the wonderful things He's done
Forgiving me, setting me free and casting my sins away
And soon as I was about to fall You stepped right in on time Picked me up and
let me know, You had nothing but love for me And those lonely nights when I
thought that I was gonna lose my mind Lord, You were my company
And now I feel joy, when I think about You I feel strength, when I think about
You No pain, when I think about You And no rain, when I think about You
I get glad, when I think about You And raise my hands when I think about You
Shout Your name when I think about You When I think about You
And in the midst of the storm You were the shelter in my life Even though, I
was doing wrong and even though I fell off No one can help me out the way You
helped me whenever I was in need When trouble was chasing, I was weak You kept
your hands on me
My God, You sacrificed Your life that I might live for eternity Despite my
faults, You heard my cry Yes, you did and forgave my inequity No one can
understand the way You understand When it comes to my heart, Lord, you gave me
a brand new start
And now I feel joy, when I think about You Feel strength, when I think about
You There is no pain, when I think about You No rain, when I think about You
I get glad, when I think about You Raise my hands when I think about You And
shout Your name when I think about You Oh, Lord, when I think about You
Listen Even though your doubts will come Believe He gave His only son to all
the world He chose to love So how can we not send our praises up
I feel joy, when I think about You Feel strength, yeah, when I think about You
There's no rain when I think about You No more pain when I think about You
I get glad, ohh, when I think about You Then I raise my hands when I think
about You Shout your name when I think about You, oh, I When I think about You
I feel joy when I think about You And peace when I think about You Feel your
presence when I think about You Coming over me when I think about You
Then I start to fall, yeah, when I think about You Down to my knees when I
think about You And begin to pray when I think about You Lord, help me, when I
think about You
Then I see the light when I think about you Startin' to shine right through
when I think about you It's a brand new day when I think about you And my
heart's renewed when I think about you
And all my fears are gone when I think about you Gone Away when I think about
you When my day looks cloudy when I think about you It's gonna be okay when I
think about you
Yeah, ohh, when I think about you When I think about you Lord, how you gave me
love when I think about you And I gave you nothing when I think about you
How you woke me up, hey, when I think about you And started me on my way when I
think about you See you did not have to do it when I think about you But you
did it any old way when I think about you
Any old, any old, any old way when I think about you Yes you did, yes you did,
when I think about you Yes you did, yes you did when I think about you Yes you
did, when I think about you
Hey, hey, hey, hey, when I think about you Hey, hey, hey, hey, when I think
about you Hey, hey, hey, hey, when I think about you Hey, hey, hey, whoo
Oh yes, when I think about you When I think about you When I think about you
