Close your eyes<br>
Now relax your mind<br>
Now I want you to picture yourself far far away<br>
(Prepare yourself girl cause we bout to take a ride)<br>
And I don’t want you to have a care in the world right now<br>
It’s just you and me<br>
In this moment… quiet<br>
Listen<br>
<br>
Baby take your mind into a zone <br>
Imagine that we all alone<br>
Two ways are off and our friends are gone<br>
Now it’s just you and me getting it on<br>
Take my hand and come with me<br>
Let’s indulge in fantasies<br>
Cast your cares and worries<br>
While we fall into this ecstasy<br>
<br>
I’m gonna rub your body, so baby just relax<br>
You’ve been pouring out your loving, so now its time to pour it back<br>
Imagine that<br>
Image that imagine that imagine that imagine that imagine imagine that<br>
Me stroking your body<br>
Image that imagine that imagine that imagine that imagine imagine that<br>
Whip cream and strawberries know what I mean<br>
Image that imagine that imagine that imagine that imagine imagine that<br>
Candles and oils surrounding the bed<br>
Image that imagine that imagine that imagine that imagine imagine that<br>
Me kissing your body from feet to head<br>
<br>
Imagine that<br>
We don’t have to talk<br>
Lay your body here and watch my fingers walk<br>
Take a second and imagine the opportunity<br>
You and me sharing sexual energy<br>
Now girl just mediate on you being in this chair<br>
Then close your eyes and act like we not even here<br>
Girl<br>
<br>
I’m gonna rub your body, so baby just relax<br>
You’ve been pouring out your loving, so now its time to pour it back<br>
