I quit you, no more, baby, no more
I quit you, you're driving me crazy
I quit you, madly you go boy so bye, bye
I quit you, cause you hurt me
But no more boy, so why Out of all the changes we've been through I got
feelings for you But I can't take this no more It's such a shame we have to go
our separate ways Just to show you I'm not the one you just can't play I feel
for you Wanna be there for you But baby boy I gotta keep it real with you So I
can not just let you run over me so I quit you, no more, baby, no more I quit
you, you're driving me crazy I quit you, madly you go boy so bye, bye I quit
you, cause you hurt me But no more boy, so why Nothing can compare to the love
that we once shared There was love on, up until You went and changed on me And
everybody knew that you were playing me Oh yeah, love was so good that I was
blind I feel for you Wanna be there for you [ From: http://www.metrolyrics.com/
 But baby boy I gotta keep it real with you And
I can not let you just run over me, so I quit you, no more, baby, no more I
quit you, you're driving me crazy I quit you, madly you go boy so bye, bye I
quit you, cause you hurt me But no more boy, so why I'm about to change the
lock Girl I So you can't get to my heart And I'll throw away the key So you
can't get in to me Got my mind on another place I can find someone who
understands To get myself another man, cause you ain't right boy I quit you, no
more, baby, no more I quit you, you're driving me crazy I quit you, yes I do
You hurt me for the last time I quit you, oh boy, playing these games with my
mind I quit you. oh yeah I quit you, I quit you yes I do I quit you I quit you
Yeah I quit you Means no more kisses, no more huggin', no more lovin'
