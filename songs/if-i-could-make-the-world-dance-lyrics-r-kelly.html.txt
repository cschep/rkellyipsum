Signs and wonders that the television shows
Hate and poverty for the more, lets me know
That life is a stage and we're all in the show Starring the world 'cause we all
blow
If we just give each other a chance Then we might just fall in love
Picture us in a land Where there's no more war Shaking hands with my brother
And respecting my sisters
I'm offering a dance that heals A melody you can feel Love is the key All it
takes is you and me, yeah
If I could make the world dance Then they would dance something like this If I
could make the world groove Then they would groove something like this
If I could make the world sing Then they would sing something like this If I
could make the world love Then it would be something like this, yeah
Tell me, why can't more hungry people overcome When they've got the means to
build bombs? Yeah We're so quick to say, "God bless America" But take away, 'In
God we trust' Tell me, what the hell is wrong with us?
Heaven If we just give each other a chance Then we might just fall in love
Picture us in a land Where there's no more war Shaking hands with my brother
And respecting my sisters
I'm offering a dance that heals A melody you can feel Love is the key All it
takes is you and me, yeah
If I could make the world dance Then they would dance something like this If I
could make the world groove Then they would groove something like this
If I could make the world sing Then they would sing something like this If I
could make the world love Then it would be something like this
