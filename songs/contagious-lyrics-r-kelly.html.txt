This is a stroy about a man comin' in
Findin' his woman in bed with, well, listen
It's 2 a.m, I'm just gettin' in, 'bout to check my message
No one has called but my homies and some bill collectors
Celluler rings, somebody wants to borrow money I two way her, she don't hit me
back, somethin' is funny
So I called her mother's house And asked her had she seen my baby Roll my 6
around, lookin for that missin' lady Got back in turned the TV on and caught
the news And I put my hand on my head 'cause I'm so confused
And then I turned the TV down 'Cause I thought I heard a squeaky sound
Somethings goin' on upstairs, yeah 'Cause I know nobody else lives here
Bomp, bomp, bomp As I get closer to the stair ways, all I hear And then I hear
my Baby's voice, in my ear Screamin' out
You're contagious, touch me, baby Give me what you got And a man say Sexy lady,
drive me crazy, drive me wild
All I heard was my baby's voice sayin' You're contagious, touch me, baby Give
me what you got Sexy lady, drive me crazy, drive me wild And I just can't
believe this shit
I ran downstairs lookin' the closet lookin' for that who Said a prayer 'cause
only God knows what I'm gonna do What I saw was enough to drive a preacher wild
I'm in the hall contemplatin' now in my own damn house Who would have thought
she was creepin' with another man The down low happened to me all over again
And then I turned the TV down 'Cause I know I heard a squeaky sound Somethin'
goin' on upstairs, yeah 'Cause I know that no one else lives here
Bomp, bomp, bomp As I get closer to the stair ways, all I hear And then I hear
my baby's voice in my ear Screamin' out
