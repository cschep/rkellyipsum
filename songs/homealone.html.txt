<i>[Keith]</i><br>
It's gonna be a party y'all<br>
Keith Murray rock vibes, verse you with Universal<br>
Where no one come, combine with R. Kelly and prove it can be done<br>
Non stoppin' Def Squad and Rockland<br>
I hear somebody knockin', yo R the party's startin'<br>
Yo, yo who's dat?<br>
<br>
<i>[R.]</i><br>
Step into the crib with me tonight (What's up baby)<br>
Kelly's in the mood to make it right<br>
Word is gettin' all over town<br>
The party's over here and gettin' down, yeah<br>
<br>
<i>[1]</i> - Hands in the air<br>
Drinks everywhere<br>
Party in the hills<br>
Keepin' it real<br>
Parents out of town <br>
Ladies all around<br>
Me and the crew doin' what we do<br>
<br>
Yeah, beat is bangin' up and down your spine<br>
And all the single women here are fine<br>
(It's a beautiful thing, it's a beautiful thing)<br>
Let your body give into your soul<br>
Release the freak in you and lose control<br>
<br>
<i>[2]</i> - Girl there's a party goin' on<br>
My temperature's warm<br>
So let me freak you through the floor<br>
While the bass is bumpin'<br>
All night if your body can handle<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
<i>[Keith]</i><br>
Chillin' at the house on the hill<br>
You gotta say my my my like Johnny Gill<br>
Hey, rich girl, poor girl get the same respect<br>
You can all drink for free and call Earl collect<br>
At the moment of truth with burden of proof<br>
We stack so you can spread love like I chose<br>
The lyrical genius with the R&B messiah<br>
And the roof, the roof we sets on fire<br>
But as long as the party is jumpin, we ain't concerned<br>
We don't need no water let the motherfucker burn<br>
And everybody who was somebody was there<br>
With they hands in the air bringing in the new year<br>
Yeah, ay yo, come on<br>
<br>
Baguettes on the wrist, it's just for shine<br>
Cuz ain't nobody checkin' out the time<br>
Cash and clothes for days to blow your mind<br>
Baby it's all good so dance tonight<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 2]</i><br>
<br>
All we want is a party<br>
A reason to celebrate<br>
Now that we got the money, oh yeah<br>
We dance the night away<br>
Nothing but the hands up<br>
<br>
