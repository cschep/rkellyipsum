Well, now he's staring at me like
As if he was starin' in a mirror
She yells, "Honey let me explain"
He says, "You don't have to go no further"
"I can clearly see what's goin' on Behind my back In my bed, in my home" Then I
said, "Wait a minute now hold on"

Tried to get him to calm down He said, "Oh, I should've known"
"That you would go and do Some bogus shit up in my house But the Christian in

says, "Somethin' I bet you didn't know my man Did she tell you that I was a
pastor?"
I said, "Well, good that's betta right Why can't we handle this Christian like"
And I started to put the gun down 'Til I saw his face still had a frown
She started cryin' Sayin', "Baby I'm sorry" Then he said, "Baby, not as sorry
As you're gonna be"
And I started inchin' out He says, "No I want you to see this" Said, "I gotta
get out this house" He said "Not 'til I reveal my secret"
I'm like what is goin' on inside his head Then he takes his phone and calls
somebody up and says "Hello, baby, turn the car around Listen, I just need for
you to get right back here now"
Click, he looks at me and says "Well, since we're all comin' out the closet I'm
not about to be The only one that's broken hearted"
She said, "What do you mean?" And he said, "Just wait and see" I said,
"Somebody betta talk to me" And then his phone rang
He picks up and somebody says "Sweetheart, I'm downstairs" And he's like, "I'll
buzz you up I'm on the fifth floor, hurry take the stairs"
And I'm like, "Who is this mystery lady That you're talking to?" He says, "In
time you both Will know the shockin' truth"
"Baby, this is something I been wanting To get off my chest for a long, long
time" Then I said, "Now I'mma shoot you both If you don't say what's on ya

He said, "Wait I hear somebody comin' up the stairs" And I'm lookin' at the
door He says, "I think you betta sit down in the chair" I says, "I'm gonna
