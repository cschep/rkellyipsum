Now I'm dashin' home, doin' 85
Swervin' lane to lane with fire in my eyes
I got a million thoughts going through my mind
I'm thinkin' about what I'ma do
And who I'm gonna do it to when I get home
How could I have been so blind And then I look in my rear view I cannot believe
this, whoo, whoo, whoo Damn, here comes a police man
He drove right up on me and flashed his light Then I pulled over without
thinkin' twice He hopped out the car and walked over to me And said license and
registration please
I looked up at him and said Officer, is there somethin' wrong He said, "No,
except you were doin' 60 in a 40 mile zone" Then I said, "Officer let me
explain please
You see the truth of the matter is Is that I have an emergency" He said, "No
excuses and no exception" He lit his cigarette as he gave me the ticket
Said, "Have a nice day", and walked away I said, "Yeah right", and drove away
Then I turned my radio on And did 55 all the way home
I pulled up in the driveway Hopped out and slammed the car door Then go in
through the back Bust up in the house and she screamin'
What's all that for then I'm like woman I called this house And a man picked up
my phone Then she said, "Calm down, did you forget My brother Twan came home"
Oh, and that's all I could say was. oh With a stupid look on my face Said, "I
forgot he came home today" And she said, "That's okay
Because honey I understand" She said, "You don't have to explain" Then I took
her by the hand I kissed her and then we went to the room
Then I turned some music on Apologized one more time Then went down and start
gettin' it on And she started bitin' her lip
Grabbing me and makin' noise Now we makin' love and she's my ear whisperin'
"It's all yours", I said, "I love you" And she said, "I love you, too"
Then a tear fell up out my eye Then I called her my sunshine And then she
looked at me And said, "Baby go deeper please"
And that's when I start goin' crazy Like I was tryin' to give her a baby The
room feel like its spinnin' We keep turnin' and turnin'
As if we were in a whirlwind The way our toes are curlin' The next thing you
know, she starts goin' real wild And starts screamin' my name
Then I said, "Baby, we must slow down Before I bust a vessel in my brain" And
she said, "Please no, don't stop" And I said, "I caught a cramp"
And she said, "Please keep on goin'" I said, "My leg is about to crack" Then
she cries out "Oh my goodness, I'm about to climax"
And I said, Cool, climax just let go of my leg She says, "You're the perfect
lover" I said, "I can't go no further", then I flip back the cover Oh my God, a
rubber, rubber, rubber, rubber
