Hey baby, I want you to do me a favor
I want you to take all of your thoughts
All of your worries and problems and forget about them
Because tonight, its about me and you
No cellulars, no pagers No two ways, just us No phone calls, take messages No
family, no friends
I just wanna be alone with you Girl, I just wanna get it on with you Well, this
Im hearing, Ill leave a clue Heres what I wanna do, baby
I just wanna take my time tonight Holding your body tight, keeping you warm
Nothing's gonna stop this feeling Ill be giving you sexual healing
I just wanna take my time tonight Holding your body tight, keeping you warm
Nothing's gonna stop this feeling Ill be giving you sexual healing
Listen, baby, no bill collectors, no landlords Your boss is tripping? Just
ignore it You got plans? Call 'em off The CD, take it off all
I just wanna be alone with you Girl, I just wanna get it on with you Well, this
Im hearing Ill leave a clue Heres what I wanna do
I just wanna take my time tonight Holding your body tight, keeping you warm
Nothing's gonna stop this feeling Ill be giving you sexual healing
I just wanna take my time tonight Holding your body tight, keeping you warm
Nothing's gonna stop this feeling Ill be giving you sexual healing
