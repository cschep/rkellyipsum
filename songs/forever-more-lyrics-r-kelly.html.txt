Baby, I've just been sitting here thinking
How blessed I am to have someone like you in my life
And I'm so excited, so, so excited about
Being with you for the rest of my life, listen
Looking at all these hand Damn, I use to be a lonely man Could never understand
Why I had no one to take my hand
But then the weather changed Mother Nature brought the sun my way Now girl,
you're who I am And I am you for the rest of my days
How the sun comes up in the early morning time Girl, I vowed to be forever
loving you rain or shine How the moon takes on this so romantic globe I'll be
lovin' you forever more
Now I used to think that I would never Have a serious relationship Always
praying for that one to come along Then give me what I miss
But now those thoughts are no more Every since you came into my life It's like
Heaven opened up it's doors Showered down on me the perfect wife
How the sun comes up in the early morning time Girl, I vowed to be forever
loving you rain or shine How the moon takes on this so romantic globe I'll be
lovin' you forever more
Baby, now our house, our house is a home The car we own, what's mine is yours
The keys to the door My family, my family, my friend, my friends The Church we
belong together, Heaven drum say Our house is a home The car we own, what's
mine is yours The keys to the door My family, my family, my friend, my friends
The Church we belong together and it's on
How the sun comes up in the early morning time Girl, I vowed to be forever
loving you rain or shine How the moon takes us on this so romantic globe I'll
be lovin' you forever more ...
