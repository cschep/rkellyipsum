<i>[Verse 1 (R. Kelly)]</i><br>
I feel that the time is here<br>
for you to bring your body here<br>
And give me what I've waited for<br>
Hurry up and come on in and close the door<br>
I'm about to get up on it<br>
Feed me girl cause I'm so hungry<br>
Got plenty money but I'm still lonely<br>
Gotta have you now cause me so---<br>
Black and Asia girl, <br>
Tattoo on your tummy<br>
Thugged out and scared<br>
But I'm uh make you love me<br>
Say some aphrodisiacs<br>
Baby girl its on<br>
I promise you I will do all these words to the song<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
Showdown<br>
(I'm about to lay your) body down<br>
(Rodeo be like) up and down<br>
(Bout to show you how I) roll down<br>
Its about to be a<br>
<br>
Showdown<br>
(I'm about to lay your) body down<br>
(My rodeo be like) up and down<br>

<i>[Verse 2 (R. Kelly)]</i><br>
I'll be making you my lady<br>
S.E.- got me going crazy<br>
Any-thing that you want me to do<br>
I'll do anything cause I'm feeling you<br>
All through the club girl you dance so freaky<br>
Tall diamond pierced with a look that kinky<br>
Ac-ting like you want me to turn you---<br>
Attitude like what, Kelly turn me now<br>
Black and Asia girl,<br>
Tattoo on your tongue<br>
Thugged out and scared<br>
But I'm uh make you love me<br>
Say some aphrodisiacs<br>
Baby girl its on<br>
I promise you I will do all these words to the song<br>

<i>[Verse 3 (R. Kelly)]</i><br>
Now gimme the mic so i can get buck wild<br>
Like fiesta, fiesta still moving the crowd<br>
Out of all the girls I've loved before<br>
Got plenty of honeys--<br>
Puff puff give now let me hit it once more<br>
Fake ass niggas get out and close my door<br>
Its my house for me to live not yours<br>
If I wanted to I could- on the floors<br>
Through the doors like a western flick the club is crunk<br>
Penny and Chris you know that boys tow up<br>
About 8 or 9 black stallion riding up<br>
Its Mr. Big screaming showdown I'm like what...<br>
<br>
<i>[Mr. Big]</i><br>
Now Kelly-<br>
Its not enough room in this town<br>
For you and me so lets get down<br>
I'm sick and tired of you and this down low fight<br>
From contagious all the way to Mrs. Price<br>
You done it now with Ms. Black Asia<br>
I knew something was funny when she stopped paging<br>
House, cars, shopping mall<br>
Man I tell you its a battle call<br>
Like a raging bull<br>
I'm about to charge<br>
Kelly, you won't see tomorrow<br>
Its time to put a end to your late night creeps<br>
Now any last words before my pistol speaks...<br>
<br>
<i>[(R. Kelly) -spits-]</i><br>
Mr. Biggs-<br>
Now no disrespect but man I'm tired<br>
Cause all these years its my back you've been riding<br>
We've been in and out of fights on these videos<br>
Now its about time you felt the real rodeo<br>
See I dated lila '98 of September<br>
You took her from me yea right you don't remember<br>
I remember so clearly we were coming from an opera<br>
How clever you were when you slipped her your number<br>
(ooh) I know that makes ya'll wanna know<br>
(ooh) Who's really on the down low<br>
You wonder why we're always at it there it is<br>
Sleeves up Mr. Biggs<br>
Cause I'm about to get- wild, wild, west<br>
Sick and tired of your mess<br>
You put me to the test <br>
And now I'm sticking out my chest<br>
So any last words before I draw these cannons<br>
Cause when the smoke clears I'll be the last man standing<br>
<br>
