I don't understand<br>
I do all this for you<br>
You contemplating on me<br>
Or is it him <br>
Or is it me<br>
Or is it him<br>
He told you he'd be there for you <br>
And he wasn't<br>
I told you I'd be there for you<br>
And I was<br>
And still is the real is <br>
Who takes care of biz<br>
Took you from apartments<br>
And got you home like The Wiz<br>
I'm not the kind of guy <br>
To give you everything<br>
But if you're real then<br>
You can get some ice in your rings<br>
You and me straight to the crib<br>
Off the tour bus<br>
Spottin' my eyes, fireplace, big as us<br>
It really don't matter<br>
Who's first in the shower<br>
Fruit platter from a young maid every hour<br>
And when it comes down to the dollar<br>
You can have it<br>
All ya gotta do is keep it hoppin' like a rabbit<br>
Friends come around don't be ready to change<br>
Treat me like a stepchild when I';m up on my game<br>
Remember I'm the first to give your cootie the pain<br>
So I wanna hear you answer when I ask you my name<br>
<br>
Ooh baby, I want you here with me<br>
And give you everything <br>
That your heart desires<br>
Lady can you feel me <br>
Do you wanna be with me for always<br>
Baby can't you see <br>
What you do to me<br>
when he do the things that he has done to you baby<br>
<br>
<i>[1]</i> - You don't need nobody to love you<br>
You don't need nobody to kiss you<br>
You don't need nobody to please you, ooh babe<br>
Cuz I can do those things if I'm wit you, baby<br>
<br>
Now who took you in when that nigga put you out<br>
And who picked you up when that nigga put you down<br>
Restraining orders keep that fool from around<br>
Had to set you up in a spot downtown<br>
See I was the one who was there for you<br>
But I'm not the one that's gonna play the two<br>
Channel bags in the trunk what you gon' do<br>
You could treat the future like a menu<br>
As long as I'm the only one to bend you<br>
And when you wanna take a flight I'm the one to send you<br>
Never be the one that's out to hurt you<br>
Tell you that I'm there and then desert you<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
Baby, can't you see<br>
What you do to me<br>
When he do the things he do to you, baby<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1 until fade]</i>
