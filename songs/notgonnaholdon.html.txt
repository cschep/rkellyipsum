Can't you see we were meant to be, oh baby<br>
Down for each other for eternity, oh baby, baby<br>
Let me know if you're out of my life<br>
(Don't hang on) Don't hang on to my heart and say bye-bye<br>
I used to be the one that you could call on<br>
Now you like to play around - hit me up on what went wrong<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
I'm not gonna hold on to your love baby<br>
If chances are that I'm gonna fall off <i>[2x's]</i><br>
<br>
Memories like the corner of my mind<br>
You know just what to do to make my love come down<br>
I know just what you need, but you don't come around<br>
Let me know if you're out of my life<br>
Don't hang on to my heart, say bye-bye, oh baby<br>
I used to be the one that you could call on<br>
Now you like to play around - hit me up on what went wrong<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus (2x's)]</i><br>
<br>
I'm not gonna hold on to your lovin' baby<br>
Look at what you're doing to me baby <i>[2x's]</i><br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus (2x's)]</i>
