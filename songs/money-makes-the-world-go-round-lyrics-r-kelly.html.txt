Yo, for those who live the way that I live We came a long way From wiping coal
outta eyelids to rap's hottest Fake Gazelles to black Pradas
Selling nicks to trey bags to making hits like Kidada Jones' father OG's would
send me to the store with a dollar Hit me with some wise advice for me to
follow Ain't nothing free in the world in life
No matter who you are, everybody got their price And some cost more than others
When you poor, it's like life ain't even worth living But when you rich, it's
every fat ass worth hittin'
With no chips, your drawers just stay on your hips I play with the six 'cuz
money make the whole world spin But without the franklin faces, you see who's
your real friends It's V-12's, honeys on the cell, bobbin' out the JBL, it's
Nas and R. Kell
Never thought that I'd ever live this life Money stacked in rolls, honeys on
each side Anything I want, I can say it's mine No more worries 'bout how can I
provide
Money makes the world go round You believe it if you want to Money makes the
world go round
Many say it's wrong 'cuz I love to spend Ice in everything countin' Benjamin's
All I wanna do, try and let you know If you don't believe, ask someone who's
broke
Money makes the world go round You believe it if you want to Money makes the
world go round Yes, it does
Said, money makes the world go round Nothing but the money makes the world go
round Yes, it does
Feels so good, yeah, yeah (So good, this life I finally live) And it feels so
real, oh, freedom (So real this freedom I finally feel) Show me the money
Money makes the world go round You believe it if you want to Money makes the
world go round
Said that almighty dollar Money makes the world go round Yes, it does
This brother's got to have it From sun up till the sun goes down (Money makes
the world go round) Yeah, so much money
(Money makes the world go round) Much money, much money Hey, it makes the world
go round, yeah (Money makes the world go round)
Show me a man that don't need money (Money makes the world go round) And I'll
show you a world standing still, oh (Money makes the world go round)
Yes, it does, talking 'bout the loot (Money makes the world go round)
