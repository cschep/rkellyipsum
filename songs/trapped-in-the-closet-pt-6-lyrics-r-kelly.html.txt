Believe it or not, I just started laughing
Shaking my head and just kept on laughing
Thinking about all the things I had been through that day
Then cries what why do you have that smile upon your face
Then I laughed out said thinking About the things that I've been through She
wipes her nose and she sniggles And laughs out I've been through it too
Then I start laughing again and she start laughing more Then next thing you
know we both are cracking up on the floor She laughs I can't believe this idiot
really answered my phone Now meanwhile Twon just got out of prison and he's on
his way home
Then she laughs baby I'm sorry For all the lies and all the bullshit Then I say
girl just wait till I tell you All the drama that I've been dealing with
She laughs I wanna hear it all Then I laugh and say baby first of all I got a
hangover, been trapped in the closet Slept who knows, threatened to kill a
pastor
She says, what baby This is no lie he had a lover turns out to be a gay guy She
says damn you've been through a lot Plus I gotta ticket
Meanwhile the policeman he turns around Just out of concern comes back to the
house Then he pulls up in the driveway My cars parked crooked with the lights
on
Then he goes around the back way He hear the dogs barking like somethings wrong
He gets to the backdoor and discover its been broken in He looks around, pulls
his gun out, then proceeds in [ From: http://www.metrolyrics.com/trapped-in-

Meanwhile were laughing and laughing and laughing But from his perspective he
thinks somebodies crying He gets closer to the bedroom And he would swear that
somebody was coughing and sighing
Meanwhile were in the bedroom laughing As I'm trying to continue to explain She
yells out Sylvester your killing me Said I swear that it went that way
Then next thing you know he bust up in the room Said bitch mutherfucker freeze
And then I looked back up at him And said wait your that damn police
Then she screams baby I mean James she says everything is cool And then he
yells Gwendolyn I got this I know your sick and tired off this fool
Then I stood up start walking toward him Screaming man get out my house Then he
yells freeze she scream Please and I pulled my barretta out
She cried out, Sylvester please don't Visions of him making love to her He said
man put the gun on the floor I can't thinking about him and her
I slowly put the gun and then I put my hands up. He winked at me and smiled And
that is when I went nuts Hopped all over him grabbed the gun
She screaming settle down Going all around both handling the gun Then all of a
sudden pow
