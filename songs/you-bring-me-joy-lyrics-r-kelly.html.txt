Ooh I'm so excited, I can't help it, I'm so fortunate to be here with you girl
And I promise that you are the only one for me out of every single woman in the
world, yes you are
And it's so much joy in the things that you do, how you do, when you do those
things you do to me
Let us lay down baby and imitate the lifestyles of the birds and bees, mmhm
Heaven must have sent your love to me 'cause when I look at you heaven is all I
see Baby you bring me joy
Chorus
You bring me joy, night and day Girl you and me should get away I've got this
special hideaway Where you and me can be alone (lovin' ya body all night long)
You bring me joy, night and day Girl you and me should get away I've got this
special hideaway Where you and me can be alone
Ooh baby this love makin' is so good I just don't know what to do with myself,
mm
And I'm sittin here thinkin' God 'cause girl he could've place you with
somebody else, uh
The way you walk, the way you dress, your smile, your grace, your sex Girl,
tonight nothing's gonna come between us but sweat
Heaven must have sent your love to me 'cause when I look at you heaven is all I
see You bring me joy
Chorus
 Baby
now that I've got you here with me, I just wanna break it down and tell you,
what I wanna do, to you
Like a mountain, woo I'm gonna climb up all on top of you girl Like a see-saw,
I'm gonna be going up and down on you girl and like a horsie, ooh I'm gonna
saddle up and ride you girl Like the river, ooh ooh ooh ooh hoh I can't wait to
see us flowin' As our bodies shivers, oooh
Heaven must have sent your love to me 'cause when I look at you heaven is all I
see
Chorus
You bring me joy, night and day Girl you and me should get away I've got this
special hideaway Where you and me can be alone  (I'll be strokin'it baby up and
down turnin' yo body all around)  You bring me joy, night and day Girl you and
me should get away I've got this special hideaway Where you and me can be alone
(Wanna hear you say my name yeah)
You bring me joy, night and day Girl you and me should get away I've got this
special hideaway Where you and me can be alone  You bring me joy, night and day
Girl you and me should get away I've got this special hideaway Where you and me
can be alone
