They think that u are crazy
But I like u like that!
You know that I'm lazy
and my stomach's gettin' fat
Oh Mystery man! Don't chew me in your horn! Mystery man! My baby's getting
born! Oh Mystery man,  I like u like that!
 They
takin' all ya money 'Cause they thinking that its funny They like to take their
chances 'Cause they thinkin' that u nothin' Oh Mystery man,  don loose your
cool Mystery man  You aint no fool! Oh Mystery Man, I like you like dat!
