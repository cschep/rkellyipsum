Baby, we both just sittin' here<br>
We need to get somewhere private<br>
Just you and me, listen<br>

And we're both just sittin' here<br>

<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
You and me chillin' on the 55th floor<br>
Right before we bump we put the sign outside the door<br>
The more we going up and down the more we wanting more<br>
It's getting hot in this car so what the hell we waiting for<br>
Can we, can we get up on<br>
Can we get up on a room<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
You don't have to go far to get a piece of me<br>
You wait in the car while I go get the keys<br>
Double lock the door for complete privacy<br>
No room service baby cuz you will be the feast, can we<br>
We'll cuddle up with each other babe, yes we will<br>
And I'll go there on this chair<br>
