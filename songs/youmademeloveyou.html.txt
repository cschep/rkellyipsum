I was just mindin my business when<br>
Ms. Prety you came walking<br>
My heart stopped said what is this just<br>
As soon as you started talking<br>
Something happened deep within me (well)<br>
All of a sudden I got this feeling<br>
A chill came from feet to head and then I<br>
Turned away from you and said to myself<br>
This is not supposed to happen brother you’ve been hurt too many times before<br>
First I tripped, then I slipped, then I fell<br>
<br>
You made me love you<br>
You made me love you babe, made me love you babe<br>
Made me love you babe, (oh Lord) made me love you babe<br>
Said you made me love you<br>
You made me love you babe, made me love you babe<br>
Made me love you babe, (good Lord) made me love you babe<br>
You made me love you babe, made me love you babe<br>
Made me love you babe, (said it wasn’t in my plans) made me love you babe<br>
Ooh, look at you<br>
<br>
Said you must be one of the top models<br>
Body curved like a pop bottle<br>
Got me sweating like a boxer baby<br>
I done stumbled up on a perfect lady (awww)<br>
Could this be what heaven sent to me<br>
An angel come to set me free<br>
Love has been a stranger to me<br>
And myself keeps telling me that<br>
This is not supposed to happen brother you’ve been hurt too many times before<br>
First I tripped, then I slipped, then I fell<br>
<br>
You made me love you<br>
You made me love you babe, (oh yes) made me love you babe<br>
Made me love you babe, (hoo) made me love you babe<br>

There’s a whole new world for my eyes to see (yes sir)<br>
So much joy darling you put in me<br>
And now the sun is shining where there used to be rain, oh Lord<br>
And now no more loneliness, no more hurt, no more pain<br>
