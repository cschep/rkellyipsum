Baby, weve been knowing each other
For a long, long time
For something like this
To just go and break up everything
Here we are just sitting here knowing we're all alone My Rolleys looking at me
saying it's time to get it on You know what I want and baby, I know what you
need So stop hesitating girl and give your love to me
All I really want is to love you, baby Make your body feel like heaven, baby I
just wanna satisfy you, baby Thats all I want, thats all I want
I just wanna give you something, baby I just wanna keep you coming, baby I just
wanna make you happy, baby Thats all I want, thats all I want
Though the fireplace is burning marshmallows just right To who it may concern
you won't be coming home tonight Body parts that he didnt kiss girl, I will
kiss for you Just put this CD on repeat and let me pamper you
All I really want is to love you, baby Make your body feel like heaven, baby I
just wanna satisfy you, baby Thats all I want, thats all I want
I just wanna give you something, baby I just wanna keep you coming, baby I just
wanna make you happy, baby Thats all I want, thats all I want
Now the swimming pools out back Come on and skinny dip baby With breakfast in
the morning Darling, compliments of me
In the middle of the night Best believe, Im going in So hold your pillow tight
'Cause I wanna do it again and again
All I really want is to love you, baby Make your body feel like heaven, baby I
just wanna satisfy you, baby Thats all I want, thats all I want
I just wanna give you something, baby I just wanna keep you coming, baby I just
wanna make you happy, baby Thats all I want, thats all I want
Till the sun comes up Baby, well be making love And when the sun goes down
Still we won't have enough
Take this love to cure It will take care of all your needs Baby, rest assure I
just wanna set you free, free yeah
