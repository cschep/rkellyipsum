When I wake up in the morning time and see the sun I say<br>
Hallelujah, thank you Jesus for waking me up today<br>
I think about his goodness and the wonderful things he's done;<br>
Forgiving me, setting me free and casting my sins away<br>
And soon as I was about to fall you stepped right in on time<br>
Picked me up, and let me know you had nothing but love for me<br>
And those lonely nights when I thought that I gonna lose my mind (my mind)<br>
Lord, You were my company<br>
<br>
And now I feel joy (when I think about you)<br>
I feel strength (when I think about you)<br>
No pain (when I think about you)<br>
And no rain (when I think about you)<br>
I get glad (when I think about you)<br>
And raise my hands (when I think about you)<br>
Shout your name (when I think about you)<br>
(When I think about you)<br>
<br>
And in the midst of the storm you were the shelter in my life<br>
Even though (I was doing wrong) and even though (I fell off)<br>
No-one can help me out, the way you helped me whenever I was in need<br>
When trouble was chasing, I was weak (mmm) you kept your hands on me<br>
My God you sacrifised you life that I might live for eternity<br>
Despite my faults, you heard my cry (yes you did) and forgave my inequity<br>
No-one can understand, the way you understand when it comes to my heart<br>
Lord you gave me a brand new start<br>
<br>
And now I feel joy (when I think about you)<br>
Feel strength (when I think about you)<br>
There is no pain (when I think about you)<br>
No rain (when I think about you)<br>
I get glad (when I think about you)<br>
Raise my hands (when I think about you)<br>
And shout your name (when I think about you) Oh Lord<br>
(When I think about you)<br>
<br>
Listen<br>
Even though your doubts will come (doubts will come)<br>
Believe he gave his only son (all of the world) to all the world<br>
He chose to love (oh, yes he did) so how can we not (how can we not) send our praises up<br>
<br>
I feel joy (when I think about you)<br>
Feel strength, yeah (when I think about you)<br>
There's no rain (when I think about you)<br>
No more pain (when I think about you)<br>
I get glad, ohh (when I think about you)<br>
Then I raise my hands (when I think about you)<br>
Shout your name (when I think about you) oh I<br>
(When I think about you)<br>
I feel joy (when I think about you)<br>
And peace (when I think about you)<br>
Feel your presence (when I think about you)<br>
Coming over me (when I think about you)<br>
Then I start to fall, yeah (when I think about you)<br>
Down to my knees (when I think about you)<br>
And begin to pray (when I think about you) Lord help me<br>
(When I think about you)<br>
Then I see the light (when I think about you)<br>
Startin' to shine right through (when I think about you)<br>
It's a brand new day (when I think about you)<br>
And my heart's renewed (when I think about you)<br>
And all my fears are gone (when I think about you)<br>
Away (when I think about you)<br>
When my day looks cloudy (when I think about you)<br>
It's gonna be okay (When I think about you)<br>
Yeah-ohh-no (when I think about you)<br>
(When I think about you)<br>
How you gave me love (gave me love) (when I think about you)<br>
And I gave you nothing (gave you nothing) (when I think about you)<br>
How you woke me up (hey!) (when I think about you)<br>
And started me on my way (started me on my way) (when I think about you)<br>
See you did not have to do it (when I think about you)<br>
But you did it any old way (when I think about you)<br>
Any old, any old, any old way (when I think about you)<br>
Yes you did, yes you did (when I think about you)<br>
Yes you did, yes you did (when I think about you)<br>
Yes you did, (when I think about you)<br>
Hey-hey-hey-hey (when I think about you)<br>
Hey-hey-hey-hey (when I think about you)<br>
Hey-hey-hey-hey (when I think about you)<br>
Hey-hey-hey whoo<br>
Oh yes (uh) (when I think about you)<br>
(When I think about you)<br>
(When I think about you)<br>
(When I think about you)
