Umm pum pum pum
Pum pum, pum pum, pum pum
Look behind myself
As I reflect on all the memories
Good times, they come and go Lost everything from friends to family
If I could turn back the hands There would be some things I'd change about me I
know that my past is not what my future holds
Where I come from who could believe All the pain and misery? Look in my eyes
and you'll see The diary of me, of me
Rewind my life Just go back and correct all the wrong And ask God to direct my
path So that I can make it home
And if I could turn back the hands of time There would be some things I would
change about me But I know that my past is not what my future holds
'Cause where I'm from who could believe All the pain, misery Look in my eyes
and you will see The diary of me
Years ago a child was born And raised without a man My mother's gone But still
reached out her hand
Just open the book Turn the pages of my life And you will read A true story
about one man's journey
Where I'm from who would believe, yeah That all the hurt and pain and misery?
Look in my eyes and you'll see The diary of me
Where I'm from who could believe The hurt and pain and misery? Look in my eyes
and you will see The makings of my diary
Where I'm from who could believe The hurt and pain and misery? Look in my eyes
and you will see The makings of my diary
Where I'm from who could believe?
