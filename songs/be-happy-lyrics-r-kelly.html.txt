Everyday and night I pray
Love will swing you back this way
Life without you here with me
Ain't the same without you g
Baby hear me, I never meant to hurt you Baby come and talk to me Let me know
what's on your mind Every time I see you You're running from me all the time
Baby hear me, I never meant to hurt you I only wanted you to be happy You to
have the best of things To be down with me, baby 'cause your lovin', it's so
good
You're giving me the run-around Thought our love was going down Baby don't you
know That I'm down until the day I die Baby hear me, never meant to hurt you
Now you know I'll never do anything to hurt you 'cause baby I love you
Every night and day I pray Your love returns Oh I'd give my life If it would
only make you happy [ From: http://www.metrolyrics.com/be-happy-lyrics-r-

Rap (notorious b.i.g) Sittin' reminiscin' on when you started dissin' Spittin'
in faces in public places Rolexes with faces had you chipper for months Made
some dough, did some shows, now you're starting to front Smokin' blunts on the
veranda with amanda She's fillin' your head with he said, she said Poppa doin'
this, poppa doin' that But don't tell him I said it 'cause my jeep might get
wetted Forget it, go on take her word like the koran Ya'll stay friends, I'll
stay and smoke phil benzs Honeysuckle sets, biggie secret pyjama sets You were
the reebok vandal, now you were chanel sandals I made you - why would I play
you?  Think about it while the streets you roam It's all peas and crispies in
the fridge when you get home
Chorus You to be, be happy You to have the best of things Baby everything you
want it for baby You to be down with me So give me that ass back baby 'cause
your lovin' is so good, so damn good, babe
Everyday and night I pray love will swing you back this way Life without you
here with me ain't the same without you g
Chorus
