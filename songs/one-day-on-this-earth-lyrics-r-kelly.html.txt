Yeah whoa~
I dropped a tear in the ocean eh
And when you find it
That's the day I'll stop loving you
C'mon
If I have only one day on this earth whoa I'll live tonight, I'll spend
tonight, make love tonight I'll sleep tonight with you by my side And if I have
only one day on this earth whoa Then I'll laugh tonight, I'll cry tonight, I'll
make it right Spend the rest of my time with you by my side
If my time was slipping away And I didn't have long to live I'd appreciate the
time we've shared And I won't want you to shed a tear If the road was coming to
an end And I couldn't turn this car around I know faith will get us, get us
through the wind And I'll be somewhere on heaven's ground
If I have only one day on this earth whoa I'll live tonight, I'll spend
tonight, make love tonight I'll sleep tonight with you by my side And if I have
only one day on this earth whoa Then I'll laugh tonight, I'll cry tonight, I'll
make it right Spend the rest of my time with you by my side
Now if this life gets the best of me And all the fame starts to fade away Just
know our love made history And know that life is a better place If there's
nothing on the television That the world was gonna end today Girl I'll be on a
mission [ From: http://www.metrolyrics.com/one-day-on-this-earth-lyrics-r-
 To love you the rest of the night away If I had one..
If I have only one day on this earth whoa I'll live tonight, I'll spend
tonight, make love tonight I'll sleep tonight with you by my side and if I have
only one day on this earth whoa Then I'll laugh tonight, I'll cry tonight, I'll
make it right Spend the rest of my time with you by my side
We could see the sunrise We could see the stars bliss Make love in the
moonlight I'll make you my bucketless We gone shop like no tomorrow Live it up
like no tomorrow Pop champagne like no tomorrow In the club like no tomorrow
You can have anything you like You're my girl I'm gonna treat you right And
when I shine you shine So have fun you only get one night And they all hating
you Diamond on you're face you behind and back They wanna take your place You
can see no never ever We gone run forever We gone be together Til forever and
ever
If I have only one day on this earth whoa I'll live tonight, I'll spend
tonight, make love tonight I'll sleep tonight with you by my side and If I have
only one day on this earth whoa then I'll laugh tonight, I'll cry tonight, I'll
make it right spend the rest of my time with you by my side
