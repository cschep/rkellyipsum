<i>[Celine]</i><br>
No mountain's too high for you to climb<br>
All you have to do is have some climbing faith, oh yeah<br>
No river's too wide for you to make it across<br>
All you have to do is believe it when you pray<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br>
And then you will see the morning will come<br>
And every day will be bright as the sun<br>
All of your fears cast them on me<br>
I just want you to see<br>
<br>
<i>[Both]</i><br>
<i>[1]</i> - I'll be your cloud up in the sky<br>
I'll be your shoulder when you cry<br>
I hear your voices when you call me<br>
I am your angel<br>
<br>
And when all hope is gone, I'm here<br>
No matter how far you are, I'm near<br>
It makes no difference who you are<br>
I am your angel<br>
I'm your angel<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br>
I saw your teardrops and I heard you cry<br>
All you need is time<br>
Seek me and you shall find<br>
You have everything and you're still lonely<br>
It don't have to be this way<br>
Let me show you a better day<br>
<br>
<i>[Celine]</i><br>
And then you will see the morning will come<br>
And all of your days will be bright as the sun<br>
So all of your fears just cast them on me<br>
How can I make you see?<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
<i>[R ]</i> And when it's time to face the storm<br>
<i>[Celine]</i> I'll be right by your side<br>
<i>[R ]</i> Grace will keep us safe and warm<br>
<i>[Celine]</i> And I know we will survive<br>
And when it seems as if your end is drawing near<br>
<i>[R ]</i> (The end is drawing near)<br>
<i>[Celine]</i> Don't you dare give up the fight <br>
<i>[R ]</i> (Oh no)<br>
<i>[Celine]</i> Just put your trust beyond the skies<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1 until fade]</i>
