Compound, Rockafella
And Ne-Yo's like young Michael, I'm Quincy
Now hear the flow that broke the Da Vinci code
I'm psycho, everything I write go together so nice
Like a wedding make you wanna throw rice
I'm schizo, clock don't tick so Write sometimes 'til the chicks go noodles I
got screws loose I pull words out the air like Bluetooth
I'm a sandwich short of a picnic, ignorant Thoughts come across you've sworn
that I written this But I didn't so maybe It's good to be crazy, isn't it baby?

I wrote your name on my wall 3000 times last night You were on my mind That's
what you do to me, that's what you do That's what you do to me, that's what you

Then one by one I went down the line just repeating it 'Cause it makes me smile
That's what you do to me, that's what you do That's what you do to me, that's
what you
Some say that it's just strange To act that way but they don't understand No,
they don't get it, you're so magnetic Though it's pathetic to them I simply
turn and say
Just call me crazy Insane, deranged, it don't matter to me Call it what you
want to, I don't care And it doesn't make a difference long as she's there
Just call me crazy Lovin' you is crazy, crazy's what I'll be Ooh crazy, ooh
crazy Ooh, just call me crazy
Lately it seems like every song I write is about you Ooh, I love your style
That's what you do to me, that's what you do That's what you do to me, that's
what you
Baby, and it just don't make no sense How my swagger is crooked if you ain't by
my side That's what you do to me, that's what you do That's what you do to me,
that's what you do
Just call me crazy Insane, deranged, it don't matter to me Call it what you
want to, I don't care And it doesn't make a difference long as she's there
Just call me crazy Lovin' you is crazy, crazy's what I'll be Ooh crazy, ooh
crazy Ooh, just call me crazy
I talk to your picture Ooh, I write your name in the mirror Right after I love
you down I need you so much, can't get enough
Just call me crazy Insane, deranged, it don't matter to me Call it what you
want to, I don't care And it doesn't make a difference long as she's there
Just call me crazy Lovin' you is crazy, crazy's what I'll be Ooh crazy, ooh
crazy Ooh
