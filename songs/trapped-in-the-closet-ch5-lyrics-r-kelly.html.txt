Well, well, well, what the fuck is this?
A condom in my bed, you better start talkin' bitch
Before I take a match and burn this mother fucker down
I said, "You better start talkin' and start talkin' right goddamn now"
Then she said "Baby, I'm so speechless Then I said, "My baby you gon' be
breathless If you don't start talkin' quick! Woman I'm gon' have a fit!"
"You don't know what you fuckin' with Girl you better cut the bullshit!" Now
it's obvious somebody has been all up in my home, in my bed Plus I smell
cigarettes
Now I'm sniffin' and lookin' around, I'm suspicious like someone's here Then I
look in her eyes and in her eyes was so much fear Pull out my gun and said is
he still here She shook her head and said, "No"
I'm checkin' behind every door She cried out, "He left right after you called I
said, "What the fuck was you thinkin' You thought that I wouldn't find this
out"
Then I said, "You must be crazy You on crack to have someone all up in my
motherfuckin' house" She hopped up and said, "That's enough" She said, "I can't
take no more"
And the she said, "You made your point But now it's time to even the score" She
said, "I know all about last night" And where you went when you left the club"
She said, "That's right nigga I was there With this guy in the back of the
club" I said, "I thought you was with your girls" She said, "I thought you was
with your guys"
She said, "You was at that bitches house And don't you even try to act
surprised" I said, "Babe", she said, "Shut up don't you say a word It ain't
nothing you can say that I ain't already heard"
Then I said, "Woman don't you try to turn it all around" 'Cause the fact still
remains that someone else was in my house" Then she said, "Your right about
that, something did go down But I don't have to turn it around 'Cause what goes
around comes back around"
I'm movin' a little closer to her, she's trippin' over the furniture She said,
"Wait first just let me explain" I said, "No need to just give me his name" And
the she says, "Ah, ah", I say, "Ah what?"
She says, "Please sit down in the chair" And I say, "No I'm standing up" And
then she cries out, "I'm so scared to tell you Because of what you might do"
And I scream, "Look girl you better give me this mans name And I'm not playin'
with you!" She says, Okay Wipes her nose and asks me about a girl name Tina
I thought to myself, said, "It sounds familiar" Then said, "I'll probably know
her if I seen her" Then I said, "Anyway girl What the hell does that got to do
with this man?"
She said, "He know my girl Roxanne" I said, "Who the hell is Roxanne?" Then she
said, "Roxanne is a friend of mine Who know this guy named Chuck
Chucks cool with this guy named Rufus" And I'm sitting there like what the
fuck Then she says, "Rufus wife Cathy, we both went to high school She
introduce me to that policeman that stopped you"
