She didn't have a house, a house up in the hills<br>
I never heard her ask for some car with the chromed out wheels<br>
But all she wanted was some love and affection<br>
But all I did all the time was neglect<br>
The fact that she was lonely, I used to be her homey<br>
I used to talk about how I was gonna get us out of the hood<br>
But as long as we're together as a family, then it's all good<br>
<br>
<i>[1]</i> - Because any man can make a baby<br>
But it takes a real man to be a father<br>
Talking about a family, the kid, you and me<br>
It's not a fantasy, but it's reality<br>
You see love is wrong and love is right<br>
But if love is strong then love is tight<br>
Talking about a chemistry like a bride-to-be<br>
It's not a fantasy, but it's reality<br>
<br>
Be careful were the words the last time we had our talk<br>
And your truth sound absurd so my pride just let you walk<br>
When all the time knowing that I didn't mean<br>
To hollar out and call you bitch and tell you leave<br>
I admit it, I was wrong but now it's over come on home<br>
I can't take it here is where you belong<br>
Even out the window looking for the mailman<br>
I hope he's got a letter says, I'm missing you, in the mail<br>
And then I saw you with another, made it hard for me to breathe<br>
But when I played the game for gives<br>
I should've played the game for keeps<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
Now I wore the shoes that you talked about in your song<br>
But it's been a change I've got a new pair on, yes<br>
Now every night and day I still await<br>
At the lonely spot in the hills<br>
And think about how you set the record straight<br>
Any man can<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1 until fade]</i>
