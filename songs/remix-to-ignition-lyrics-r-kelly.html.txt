Now, usually, I don't do this but uh
Go head' on an' break 'em off
Wit a lil' previews of the remix
Now I'm not trynna be rude
But hey pretty girl I'm feelin' you The way you do the things you do Reminds me
of my Lexus coupe
That's why I'm all up in ya grill Tryna get you to a hotel You must be a
football coach The way you got me playin' da field
So baby gimme that, "Toot toot" And lemme gi' ya that "Beep beep" Runnin' her
hands through my fro Bouncin' on twenty fo's While they sayin' on the radio
It's the remix to ignition Hot and fresh out the kitchen Mama rollin' that body
Got every man in here wishin'
We're sippin' on coke and rum I'm like, so what I'm drunk It's the freakin'
weekend Baby, I'm about to have me some fun
Bounce, bounce, bounce Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce Bounce, bounce, bounce,
c'mon
Now it's like "Murda She Wrote" Once I getcha out them clothes Privacy is on
the do' But still they can hear ya screamin' mo'
Girl I'm feelin' whatchu feelin' No more hopin' and wishin' I'm about to take
my key an' Stick it in da ignition
So gimme that "Toot toot" Lemme gi' ya that "Beep beep" Runnin' her hands
through my fro Bouncin' on twenty fo's While they sayin' on the radio
It's the remix to ignition Hot and fresh out the kitchen Mama rollin' that body
Got every man in here wishin'
We're sippin' on coke and rum I'm like, so what I'm drunk It's the freakin'
weekend Baby, I'm about to have me some fun
Crystal poppin' in the stretch Navigata We got food everywhere as if the party
was catered We've got fellas to my left, hunnies on my right We bring 'em both
together we got drinkin' all night
Then after the show it's the after party And after the party it's the hotel
lobby Around about four you gotta clear the lobby Then take it to ya room and
somebody
Can I get a "Toot toot"? Can I get a "Beep beep"? Runnin' her hands through my
fro' Bouncin' on twenty fo's While they sayin' on the radio
It's the remix to ignition Hot and fresh out the kitchen Mama rollin' that body
Got every man in here wishin', c'mon
We're sippin' on coke and rum I'm like, so what I'm drunk It's the freakin'
weekend Baby, I'm about to have me some fun
'Cause it's the remix to ignition Hot and fresh out the kitchen Mama rollin'
that body Got every man in here wishin'
We're sippin' on coke and rum I'm like, so what I'm drunk It's the freakin'
weekend Baby, I'm about to have me some fun
Girl we off in this jeep foggin' windows up Blastin' the radio in the back of
my truck Bouncin' up and down, strokin' round and round To the remix we jus'
thuggin' it out
