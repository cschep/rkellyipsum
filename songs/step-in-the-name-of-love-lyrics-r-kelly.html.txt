Some believes in love and some people don't Similar to a story when it's told
(A thousand years from now) (We'll be still puttin' down, my baby)
Some have cross the finish line and some gave up It's like movin' a mountain,
love can be just that tough, yeah (A thousand years from now) (We'll be still
putting it down, my baby)
Baby girl in other words for ever more I'll be here (I'll be here) 'Cause, my
