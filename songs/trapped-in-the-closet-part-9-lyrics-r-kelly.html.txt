He looks around the kitchen, and says, Something is really weird
And she says, Why do you say that?
He says, Cos you keep tryin' to get me out of here
He said, Ever since I been in this house
Your face has went from white to red And remember when I first walked through
the door You acted like you had seen a ghost from the dead?
Then he says, Girl if you hidin' something, I'm gonna be so mad Then he hears
something fallin, he says, What the fuck was that? She said, It sounds like
it came from upstairs, sounds like the plumbing He said, Woman that sound did
not come from upstairs! I'll be damned if you're not up to something!"
He said, "Now the sound that I just heard, it came from this kitchen And then
he looks over by the stove, while shes easin' over by the dishes And then he
walks over to the refrigerator and pushes it back And then he looks her in her
face Looks like shes about to have a heart attack Then he notices the pie on
the counter, one slice is missing Now the storys gettin' scary, cos he comes
to realize That Bridget is allergic to cherries
Then he slowly looks up at her, and now her face is red as hell He's breathing
real hard, and movin' closer She says, Hon, you don't look so well And then
he says, Move She says, No He says, Move She says, No! Bitch move!
She moves
And then, he looks at the cabinet He walks to the cabinet Get close to the
cabinet Now he's opening the cabinet Now pause the movie, cos what I'm about
to say to ya'll is so damn twisted Not only is there a man in his cabinet But
the man is a midget!
