Pussy is a whole different aspect of life
Wars don started from country to country over they women
Pussy is one of the most powerful things in the world
And a lot of people don't understand how powerful pussy is
Pussy makes niggas blow they brains they bitch brains out Or, or, or, or pussy
makes people do thangs They never would think they do
The power of the P U S S Y That's why every motherfucka in the world dress fly
Every baller that can afford it they cop da best ride For the power of the P U
S S Y, let's have some fun
S S Y That's why nigga's get haircuts, try to dress fly Every balla that can
afford it he cop the best ride For the power of the P U S S Y
I know this girl, we call her sweet cooch brown Hands down mami had the bombest
pussy in town One dip in the girl pool that's all it took One sample of the
snapple and your ass was
Whup have you buying Gucci sandles, matching pocketbooks Blowing up her beeper
ringing her phone off the hook Ballplayers spent money, rappers they spent time
All the while both claiming that they never spent a dime
Business guys she would victimize Have 'em paying rent on condos in a Miami
high rise They ask her who's pussy's this looking her right in her eyes She
said this pussy's yours daddy telling 'em nothing but lies
Ha, they didn't believe her but they wanted to needed to She had the type of
body that you didn't want leaving you So they ignored all the flirtin' ways And
put a ring on her finger I'm like Earth to Dave
The power of the P U S S Y That's why every motherfucka in the world dress fly
Every baller dat can afford it they cop da best ride For the power of the P U S
S Y
The power of the P U S S Y, ha That's why nigga's get haircuts, try to dress

Cadillac Now this bitch be creeping behind this niggas back
He busted her, guess what he still took the bitch back Three things niggas love
money, pussy and drugs Can't get one without the other unless you softer then

R&B thug
