Seems like we're done here
Looks like that's everything
She walks by one last time
Checks for her things and leave the keys behind
There will be more tears As she's beginning to drive away It's all clear now
There's no real reason to have the pain
Now I know love has kept me here and my pride has kept me here And hope keeps
singing it's alright, I'll be fine
But she'll be going elsewhere And she'll be lying else where And she'll be
wanted elsewhere And I'll be somewhere thinking about her
And she'll be living elsewhere And she'll be laughing elsewhere And she'll be
happy elsewhere And I'll be just fine without her someday That's what I keep
telling myself
Was it the right thing? Was this our biggest mistake? Still call sometimes but
she's got nothing to say And still she stays away
It's got me questioning If I ever meant the same to her How could she? Why
would she do these things? Put me through this pain now
If love is what we have then how could it have been so bad That she don't think
it's worth a fight, she won't try
But she'll be trying elsewhere And she'll be loving elsewhere And she'll keep
secrets elsewhere And I'll be somewhere thinking about her
And she'll be willing elsewhere And she will be giving elsewhere And she'll
have feelings elsewhere But hope keeps saying Kells, you can make it
But in the meantime I can't sleep, I can't think There's so many things in my
head Things she said, things that she meant Things that I started feeling the
day that she left
Things that I slept on, things that I should have accepted Things I expected
and the things I neglected I better get up off my Catch the first flight out
and get her back or else
She'll be living elsewhere And she'll be crying elsewhere And shell be feeling
elsewhere And I'll be somewhere thinking about her
She'll be smiling elsewhere And she'll be laughing elsewhere Giving all of my
sweet love away elsewhere That's the reason why I gotta catch that flight I'm
out of time
