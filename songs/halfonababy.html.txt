Oh, na, na, na, na, na, na<br>
Your body, na, na, na, na<br>
Oh, na, na, na, na, na, na<br>
You're body, na na na na<br>
<br>
Turn the lights down low<br>
I'm ready to break it off<br>
Since computer love<br>
Been wanting to set it off<br>
<br>
Like a hotel room<br>
I'm checkin' into you<br>
I'm diggin' like a shovel<br>
All the things you do<br>
<br>
Take a leep over the broom<br>
That's how you're makin' me feel<br>
Come on in this room<br>
And let's keep it real and go<br>
<br>
<i>[1]</i> - Half on a baby<br>
All I need is your body next to me<br>
Singing ooh, na, na, na, na, na, na, na<br>
Give me your body, your body, na, na, na, na<br>
<br>
Half on a baby<br>
All I need is your body next to me<br>
I'm singing ooh, na, na, na, na, na, na<br>
Give me your body, your body, na, na, na, na<br>
<br>
Now tell me what the deal is<br>
Are you ready to bump<br>
It's gonna take a lifetime<br>
To give you all of this love<br>
So baby, open up<br>
And get ready to receive<br>
A miracle of love<br>
Gettin' down wit me<br>
<br>
Like a baseball field<br>
Wanna hit a home run<br>
Me and you get together babe<br>
And raise a little one<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
Set it off in a six<br>
Baby, that'll be cool<br>
Take a trip downtown<br>
Between me and you<br>
Trippin' on Perignon<br>
Conversation like what<br>
Not afraid to go down<br>
Once you open up<br>
After nine to five<br>
You deserve some twelve<br>
Makin' future plans<br>
To be where I dwell<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
From my toes up<br>
To my knee caps<br>
To waist line<br>
Now slowly lady<br>
Can we go half on a baby<br>
<br>
From my toes up<br>
To my knee caps<br>
To waist line<br>
Now slowly lady<br>
Can we go half on a baby<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1 until fade]</i>
