There is strength deep inside me that I never knew I had <br>
There's a fire within burnin' bright <br>
There is a love inside of me that I never thought I'd feel <br>
Until the day you came into my life, yeah <br>
<br>
And it was you that were there when no one else was <br>
And you show me a love unknown, ooh <br>
<br>
You kept the fire burnin' <br>
You kept hope alive <br>
And when my soul was fallin' <br>
You helped me to survive <br>
And you led the way <br>
Encouraged me to take that leap of faith <br>
<br>
There's a dream that I dream, I never knew it would come true <br>
There's a place I never thought that I would be (Ooh) <br>
There is a chance (There's a chance) that I took<br>
(That I took) that I never thought I'd take <br>
Until you came and helped me to believe, oh...oh... <br>
<br>
You were there when no one else was <br>
And you showed me a love unknown <br>
<br>
You kept the fire burnin' <br>
And you kept hope alive <br>
And when my soul was fallin' <br>
You helped me to survive <br>
And you led the way <br>
Encouraged me to take that leap of faith (Of faith, of <br>
faith, of faith, of faith, ooh) <br>
<br>
Leap of faith <br>
Oh, yeah <br>
Oh...oh...oh...oh... <br>
<br>
You showed me just how <br>
{How to believe in me} In me, oh... <br>
You moved that tree and tore that forest there for me <br>
<br>
You kept the fire burnin' (You kept it burnin') <br>
You kept hope alive (You kept hope alive) <br>
And when my soul was fallin' (My soul was fallin') <br>
You helped me to survive (Yeah, you helped me to survive) <br>
You led the way <br>
Encouraged me to take that leap of faith, yeah <br>
<br>
You kept the fire burnin' (Woo) <br>
You kept hope alive (You kept the hope alive, yeah) <br>
And when my soul was fallin' (My soul was fallin') <br>
You helped me to survive (But you helped me to <br>
survive) <br>
You led the way <br>
Encouraging me to take <br>
<br>
The fire {Everybody}, hope {All my life} <br>
My soul {Someone's callin'} with you {I'll survive} <br>
You led {Go away}, encouraged me {To take} <br>
That leap of faith and make it over <br>
Now I owe my thanks to you, ho...oh... <br>
<br>
You kept the fire burnin' (Woo, hey) <br>
You kept hope alive (You kept hope alive) <br>
When my soul was fallin' (When my soul was fallin') <br>
You helped me to survive (Ooh...you helped me to survive) <br>
Oh...yes, you did <br>
Pushing me to take that leap of faith <br>
<br>
You kept the fire burnin' <br>
You kept hope alive <br>
And when my soul was fallin' <br>
You helped me to survive <br>
Oh...oh...oh...oh...
