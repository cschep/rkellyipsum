Rockland<br>
In my life<br>
Uhh, Track Masters<br>
You're all I need in my life<br>
Make money<br>
You're all I need in my life<br>
Duece, duece<br>
You're all I need in my life<br>
<br>

Uh huh, yo, yo, yo, yo<br>
I remember in the days <br>
Y'all niggas talking all that shit about keepin' it real<br>
But when it comes to this game I'mma play the field<br>
Rockland had loot before we signed the deal<br>
Haters get in the way and catch the sky like Seal<br>
We used to use the streets for the football field<br>
In church free lunch was our only meal<br>
But now we push whips with Lorenzo wheels<br>
Living it up in Beverly Hills<br>
<br>
<i>[Tone]</i><br>
You know 9 to 5 was only temporary<br>
Now the ladies wanna find Tone in a hurry<br>
Got 'em hittin' notes that Mariah couldn't carry<br>
All you player haters going down like Mary<br>
Cop the Rolls Royce a player with a choice<br>
Ladies stay moist from the sound of my voice<br>
The lady killers pass the keys to our villas<br>
Rockland, Track Masters top billers<br>

<i>[1]</i> - Only the loot can make me happy<br>
(Nothing but the loot baby)<br>
Happy (Show me the loot baby)<br>
Happy (Show me the loot)<br>
<br>
Only the loot can make me happy<br>
(Nothing but the loot baby)<br>
Happy (Show me the loot baby)<br>
So happy (Show me the loot)<br>
<br>
I never thought that I <br>
Could make someone like you<br>
I felt energized <br>
When you went through my groove<br>
I'll never let you go no<br>
You're so right for me<br>
I've got to let you know<br>
Forever you and me<br>
(The balla's anthem right here)<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
You must be heaven sent<br>
Sent into my life<br>
And I compliment you honey the money<br>
We have a love that's long <br>
And true I make you in many ways<br>
I've got to roll with you<br>
In each and every day<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
You're all I need in my life<br>
I don't need no one I don't need no one but you<br>
You're all I need in my life<br>
I don't need no one I don't need no one but you<br>
I said you're all I need in my life<br>
I don't need no one I don't need no one but you<br>
You're all I need in my life I don't need no one<br>
I don't need no one but you<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
You're all I need in my life<br>
I said you're all I need in my life
