Down low double life<br>
1, 2 equals us, she, she and me, I fell in loves<br>
How could something so right go so wrong<br>
Just coming in on flight 412<br>
But she was listening on the phone<br>
I thought I had it all together<br>
But I was wrong obviously<br>
Cuz what was once done in the dark<br>
Came to light eventually<br>
<br>
<i>[1]</i> - Living down low, down low<br>
Living that double life<br>
Living down low, down low<br>
Living that double life<br>
It ain't right<br>
<br>
I don't believe the shit I did the night we were at your mom's<br>
I got a page from out of town, lied and said it was my job<br>
Grabbed my hat, coat, gloves and scarf<br>
I told you that I would return<br>
But by the look upon your face you had already discerned<br>
You pulled me to the side and you begged for me to stay<br>
But I was caught up in a life that forced me to walk away<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
Okay you, you're saying you came in and<br>
And these two women they, they poured<br>
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, it wasn't nothing like that<br>
All I know is uh, I was asleep, they came in<br>
Woke me up pourin' hot grits<br>
And all kinds of shit on me man, okay beatin' me and shit<br>
Hittin' me with all sorts of type shit (Damn)<br>
<br>
With a cigar in my mouth over Vegas city lights<br>
On a path way up the hill to be with my other wife<br>
A rich nigga living strife going on like nothing's wrong<br>
But that damn Caller ID is the reason for this song<br>
So one called up the other while I was out playing some golf<br>
Talking about my doggish ways and how I need to be droppped off<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
Now go ahead, shoot me now because I'm guilty as sin<br>
Playin' Russian roulette with hearts not to mention the kids<br>
Now every day I live I regret all that I did<br>
Out smoking with friends as I reminisced<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
I can't take it no more I've got to confess<br>
See now, I don't know why<br>
I thought that I could keep creeping<br>
Cuz you see what goes around<br>
Comes back on around and back on around<br>
And back on around again, yes it does<br>
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh <br>
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh<br>
In a state of shock that's what it left me<br>
Take it from a man who knows<br>
That three ain't company<br>
No, no, no that's what I kept telling myself<br>
Now I done lost the houses the kids and the dogs<br>
Now I'm sleeping in my momma's house<br>
And even she says, your sorry ass don't deserve no help<br>
Must be because of what my old man did to her<br>
Niggas<br>
