Early one Sunday morning<br>
Breakfast was on the table<br>
There was no time to <br>
Eat<br>
She said to me boy hurry to Sunday school<br>
Filled with the long of glory <br>
We learned the holy story<br>
She'll always have her dreams<br>
Despite the things <br>
<br>
This troubled world can bring.<br>
<br>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br>
<br>
Oh Sadie don't you know we love you sweet Sadie<br>
<br>
Place No one above you sweet Sadie<br>
<br>
Well Well Well<br>
<br>
Living in the past<br>
<br>
Sometimes it seems so funny, no money can turn your life around<br>
<br>
Sweeter than cotton candy<br>
Stronger than papas' old Brandy<br>
Always that needed <br>
Smile<br>
Once in awhile she would break down and cry<br>
Sometimes she'd be so <br>
Happy<br>
Being with us and daddy<br>
Standing the worst of times<br>
Breaking the <br>
Binds with just a simple song<br>
<br>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br>
<br>
Oh Sadie<br>
She's Loving my song in a special way<br>
Sweet Sadie<br>
Living in the <br>
Past<br>
Oh she's never sinning in Love she's always winnin<br>
My my my my my<br>
I <br>
Love you mama<br>
I just can't forget how you gave me love oh no<br>
If there's a <br>
Heaven up above I know she's teaching angels how to love<br>
Its a mean world <br>
Without ya<br>
And I surely miss you much mother<br>
And now that your gone I'm <br>
Gonna carry on<br>
Cause your cryin lady<br>
Ooh sadie<br>
When I think about the <br>
Things that you done for me<br>
Hey it brings a joy way down deep inside of me<br>
<br>
Oh oh oh oo oh<br>
See I love you mama<br>
Yes I do<br>
I'll never forget you mama no <br>
Oh oh oh
