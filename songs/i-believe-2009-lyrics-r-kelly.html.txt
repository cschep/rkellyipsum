I Believe lyrics By R. KELLY
BARACK OBAMA:
In small towns and big cities
We came together
As democrats, republicans, and independents To stand up and say that we are ONE
NATION, we are ONE PEOPLE And our time for changed has COME..
R. KELLY: When the mountain seems too high And you dont have the courage nor
the strength to climb And the road youre on wont end But still you run though
you cannot see the finish line
And dark clouds are over you Your skies no longer blue But you marched on
straight ahead Somehow you made it through
Got to the mountain peek They left a path of me Your victory made history and
now
CHORUS: I believe, I believe, I believe Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe Oh,
I believe, I believe, I believe Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe Oh I
When it felt like you were weak And couldnt fight no more On the ropes and it
seemed like You was gonna run out of breathe
When the world was on your shoulder And the walls were in your way You leaped
and made it over Through it all you kept the faith [ From: http://

With hope you set us free You showed us how to dream And now we can lift our
voices And forever sing
Nows the time to look ahead And thank our heros of the past And celebrate
this history Lets raise the flag cause
CHORUS: I believe, I believe, I believe Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe Oh,
I believe, I believe, I believe Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe Oh I
BRIDGE: And when they tried to keep you down You kept up your head Never losing
sight You believed in what was right
You endured to the end Walked through the strongest wind The storms over And a
new day begins
And when our hope was dying You brought us healing And now I got something To
tell my children
CHORUS: I believe, I believe, I believe Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe Oh,
I believe, I believe, I believe Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe Oh I
