She did something to me, I dont know what it is, but when I walked in the club
I was like..(allright, uha, owh!)
When I first saw shawty in the club she was walkin through short skirt and
stilettos on
Walk right be me with a switch and a hip lookin at me all sexy turning me on
While Im posted up like a player, folded my arms and rubbed on my chin I am
focused on that booty man just plot know how to get in
(Chorus) Shes a bad girl and I want it  Shes a bad girl and she knows it Man
I give her a ten in a do  Its a rap shit competition no mo She got the whole
club in slowmo And she knows it..
Said she know what shes doin, ey.. ey.. ey.. Said she know what shes doin,
ey.. ey.. ey..(look at her she know that) Said she know what shes doin, ey..
ey.. ey..(girl is a pro) Said she know what shes doin, ey.. ey.. ey..(oeh
