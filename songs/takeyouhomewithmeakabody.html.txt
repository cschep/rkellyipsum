<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br>
Uh, uhh uhh, Kel's<br>
Young, M, X, tra, money, let's go<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus 2X: R. Kelly + (Girl)]</i><br>
Girl you know you got a body-adi-adi (do you like it?)<br>
Where you get your little body-adi-adi (do you want it?)<br>
Girl I wanna freak your body-adi-adi (what you want it?)<br>
I just wanna take you home with me<br>
<br>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br>
She get it from her momma..<br>
You can't tie a sweater over that ass, it hotter than pajamas<br>
We lay back, blowin ganja<br>
DVD, she make it hard to watch a flat TV - WHOA<br>
I crept up behind her<br>
Mami threw it like a quarterback, I caught that like Rice<br>
I call mami Montana, bandana<br>
Tied her hands up - this is gangsta love<br>
Threw on a rap CD, we gangsta fucked<br>
This ain't R&B smooth, I ain't a R&B dude<br>
Poured a glass of Army, got mami in the mood<br>
Then she stripped for me like the "Moulin Rouge"<br>
I think I might wife her<br>
Y'know, powder blue Roc-a-Wear suit, white Nike her<br>
Add mami to the cypher<br>
R.O.C. for life cuz, the gang motherfucker<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br>
I make ya hotter than the next bitch - no need<br>
for you to ever sweat the next bitch - with speed<br>
I make the next bitch see the exit - indeed<br>
Gotta know you're ver-ily respected - by me<br>
You get the keys to the Lexus - but no drive<br>
You get your own 2002, she through ridin<br>
Keep yo' ass tighter than Versace<br>
That's why you gotta watch yo' friends<br>
You gotta watch me, they connivin shit<br>
See I just wanna freak your body-adi-adi<br>
I know you don't do this for everybody-adi<br>
But everybody ain't as horny as me<br>
And your body's - callin, me...<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
<br>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br>
Uhh, yeah<br>
Mami shot through the pad with the Mark Jacobs bag<br>
The thick stitched seam and her favorite ass jeans<br>
Y'all know the first date wearers<br>
to make objects bigger than they appear like a rearview mirror<br>
Oh her shoe game is real<br>
She gave 'em the Christian Libountins(?) with the four inch heels<br>
But honestly my favorite type of gear<br>
is a scrungy for her hair and LaPearla underwear, clear?<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br>
Girl I hear you callin, let's stop stallin<br>
Do what we came to do<br>
Girl I hear you callin, let's stop stallin<br>
Baby I want you, yeah<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
