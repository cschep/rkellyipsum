Yo, what up my nigga
You know I was in the hood
I just thought I'd stop by and
Holler at you for a minute
Pour out a little liquor or somethin'
Nigga we done been through a lot of shit together From runnin' these streets to
bein' down for whatever And now that you're gone I got a whole lot of shit to
tell you Things I should've said way back when we was younger
Remember when we used to roll hand in hand And now I'm trippin' on how I really
miss you man And remember when you and me would say We'd get up out this hood
and everything would be okay
It's all good now my nigga we out the hood now And we had the same ideas but
not the same careers We shared the same old laugh and now the same tears
You were my homie, my sconey, my roni My nigga and never placed no bitch before
me Man, I sear to God I love you for that shit Why'd you have to get hit, where
was I, what time was it
You were supposed to get older with me On stage, hands on shoulders with me
Coppin' them Range Rovers with me Sittin' on thangs and smokin' trees
And if it wasn't for the will that God had made I'd turn back the hands of time
and take your place Sittin' here sippin' on this Hennessey Just thinkin' about
what you meant to me my nigga
Even when you're gone you will always be my nigga When you went home I'm still
missin' you, my nigga I'm feelin' like the timing was wrong, my nigga I know
you're smilin' down sayin' carry on, my nigga
Some times my nights can get long, my nigga Some times I feel that God did me
wrong, my nigga So I had to write a song, my nigga Just to let you know that
you're still my nigga
I wish, I wish, I wish I wish, I wish, I wish
Little son is lookin' at me like where is my daddy? And your 13 year old
daughter is mad 'cause she understands Promised your mama I'd take care of the
family But shes so hurt, she turns away my helpin' hands
Damn, I wish your ass was here my nigga To grow that gray beard and smoke that
cigar my nigga And we would talk about you gettin' up out this game And you
would tell me how it keeps callin' your name
We used to ride ride ride Never afraid to die die die But some times we cry,
cry, cry Askin' the lord why why why They're tearin' down these projects
We were homies for like 20 thug years Sat in church and cried the same thug
tears And you remember when vibe world premier How we used to share the same
old gear
And remember when you and me would say We'd get up out this hood and everything
would be okay
It's all good now my nigga we out the hood now It's so easy for folks to say,
rob just live on When I'm dyin' every second that you're gone Never the less I
try my best to be strong Hopin' you said your prayers before you went on home
When we stood on these blocks and just shot the breeze We'd slap box dead in
the middle of streets And if a fight broke out, you would take up for me You're
all I have left of these ghetto memories
I wish, I wish, I wish I wish, I wish, I wish
Uh, uh, yo dog, I cant explain how I miss you We stayed together, coppin' cane,
poppin' pistols I miss you most puttin' the doo rag over your bean head Even
out the hood on the scene you brag
Comin' up off the fiends for bags Runnin' up out the cleaners, drag You was the
closest nigga I had Look how we stayed aces hustled made big faces
I wish we could trade places Fuck givin' you ice, I'd rather give you life And
the things that I had, I'd give you twice
So what the deal, my nigga, I know you holdin' it down If you could see me you
would say I'm talkin' soft right now But it's hard for me to see when I'mma see
you again And I know its fucked up, I gotta talk through this pen
But you'd died for the love of the dough The love of the block, 16 you was
runnin' the spot Boy, your mama used to hate how we stood on the curb Hangin'
with wild thug niggas, smokin' the herb
I'm gonna keep pourin' this liquor and that's my word This here is for niggas
that be flippin' them birds, word up
Even though you know you will always be my nigga Even though you're gone you
will also be my nigga I'm feelin' like the time when I'm high, my nigga When
you're gone, when you're gone my nigga
Some times my nights can get long, my nigga Some times I feel that God did me
wrong, my nigga So I had to write a song, my nigga Just to let you know that
you're still my nigga
