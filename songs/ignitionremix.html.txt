<br>
No I'm not tryin to be rude, <br>
But hey pretty girl I'm feelin you<br>

Remind me of my Lexus coup<br>
Thats why im all up in yo grill<br>

You must be a football coach<br>
The way you got me playin the field<br>
<br>
So baby gimme that toot toot <br>
Lemme give you that beep beep<br>
Runnin her hands through my 'fro<br>
Bouncin on 24's <br>
While they say on the radio...<br>
<br>
It's the remix to ignition<br>
Hot and fresh out the kitchen<br>
Mama rollin that body<br>
got every man in here wishin<br>
Sippin on coke and rum<br>
I'm like so what I'm drunk<br>
It's the freakin weekend baby <br>
I'm about to have me some fun<br>
<br>
Bounce Bounce Bounce Bounce Bounce Bounce Bounce<br>
Bounce Bounce Bounce <br>
<br>
Now it's like murder she wrote <br>
Once I get you out them clothes<br>
Privacy is on the door<br>
Still they can hear you screamin more<br>
Girl I'm feelin what you feelin <br>
No more hopin and wishin<br>
I'm bout to take my key and<br>
Stick it in the ignition<br>
<br>
So baby gimme that toot toot <br>
Lemme give you that beep beep<br>
Runnin her hands through my 'fro<br>
Bouncin on 24's <br>
While they say on the radio...<br>

Crystall poppin in the stretch Navigator<br>
We got food every where <br>

We got fellas to my left<br>
Hunnies on my right<br>
We bring em both together we got junkin all night<br>
Then after the show its the (after party)<br>
And after the party its the (hotel lobby)<br>
And round about 4 you gotta (clear the lobby)<br>
Then head take it to the room and freak somebody <br>
