It's Saturday<br>
I'm ready to go out and have some fun<br>
Get in the club around 'bout twelvish<br>
Me my homies hoochie huntin'<br>
Lovin' the way the DJ's mixin'<br>
And everybody's on the floor<br>
Moet, Alize<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
Every day and every night humpin' and bouncin'<br>
All I wanna do <i>[2x's]</i><br>
Summertime, Saturday night <i>[background]</i><br>
<br>
<i>[Conversation:]</i><br>
"Hey, what'cha doin'? <i>[female]</i><br>
"Chillin', strokin' the town." <i>[male]</i><br>
"Sure you don't wanna come over here?"<br>
"Nah, I ain't comin' over there, man."<br>
"What you mean you ain't comin' over here.?"<br>
"'Cause you don't be talkin' about doing shit."<br>
"Who you wit?"<br>
"Don't worry about who I'm wit."<br>
"See, that's why I don't call you."<br>
<br>
It's time to be havin' a good time tonight<br>
Music got you in the mood, you'll be dancin' all night<br>
Lovin' the way the DJ's mixin' and everybody's on the floor<br>
I can't seem to stop thinkin' about you, baby<br>
No matter what I do<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus (2x's)]</i><br>
<br>
I know you're here to party<br>
Everybody work it out<br>
Leave all your troubles behind<br>
Let me see you hump and bounce<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus (2x's)]</i><br>
<br>
Help me find a way to that spot tonight<br>
Kelly, won't you help me find a way<br>
I can help you find a way<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
