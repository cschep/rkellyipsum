<i>[R KELLY]</i><br>
I been around the world and back like what up<br>
East side to west side tourin like what up<br>
And even though the price for the house was so much<br>
I still roll with them from the hood like what up<br>
Cuz when it comes to bein the realest im sho nuff<br>
Im a straight up industry villain fo sho nuff<br>
And I cant satisfy some a yall no matter what<br>
And some of ya'll cats are so jealous<br>
Said we livin in a cold cold world<br>
Aint nuttin but fake faces fake people fake friends<br>
Said we livin in a cold cold world<br>
Where there aint nuttin but envy wannabees playa-hatas<br>
Yea I know I need a hug but yall need a hug too<br>
Cuz god gunna judge me the same day he judge you<br>
And even though we have our struggles that’s alright<br>
You know we get our folks and find a way to shine<br>

<i>[JA RULE]</i><br>
Sometimes this world can be so cold<br>
When you looking through the windows of the soul<br>
I been looking to see the truth as it unfolds<br>
Cuz I been around this globe and back <br>
Enough to know the fact<br>
Who loves me<br>
And who loves me not<br>
We be shit’s so hot<br>
You could put it in red tops<br>
And pump it through every hood, ghetto, and block<br>
Until they heart stops<br>
That’s why they fiend for me<br>
And I thank you for every blessing that you givin me lord<br>
And im grateful for all my talent and my vocal accords <br>
And all these hatas I keep shakin em off<br>
Rubbin they face in fame<br>
Im sorry I changed the game<br>
But its mine and I cant complain<br>
Rule and R Kelly<br>
Been around the world<br>
Puttin it on women<br>
Bumpin n grindin these bitches<br>
But we always on time when a woman fed up<br>
And that’s love<br>
That’s why they all fuck wit us<br>
<br>

<i>[R KELLY]</i><br>
Said my lyrics is my testimony<br>
That’s how I live<br>
I had to get rid of a lotta fake homies<br>
Over the years<br>
You see me on tv sometimes<br>
Not how it is<br>
Yall gotta start learnin how to separate me from showbiz <br>
When im rollin through your city<br>
Show me love<br>
And ladies when you see a boy<br>
Give me love<br>
And though im not conceited (right)<br>
Its jus my space sometimes I need it (right)<br>
Said I got so many friends in them area codes<br>
That I hand out them tickets when it comes to my shows<br>
Ja lets break bread together<br>
Pray together<br>
That we grow strong together<br>
Its clear forever<br>
Help each other through the stormy weather<br>
Lets hurt together<br>
Lets cry together<br>
And even if we grow together<br>
Then together we'll make it better<br>
<br>
