I wish, I wish, I wish
To every city
I wish, I wish, I wish
Every hood
I wish, I wish, I wish And every block I wish, I wish, I wish Ghetto America
Rollin' through the hood, just stopped by to say, what's up? And let you know
your baby boy ain't doin' so tough Even though you passed, goin' on four long
years Still wakin' up late at night cryin' tears
Just thinkin' about those days you used to talk to me Smilin' while I'm sippin'
on this Hennessey And remember, we'd brag on how rich we would be To get out
this hood was like a fantasy
And now you hear my songs the radio is playin' Oh, I can't believe my ears And
what everybody is sayin' Boy, I tell you folks don't know the half
I would give it all up just to take one ride With you How I used to kick it on
the front porch With you And how I used to lay back and smoke weed With you And
all the little basement party joints we'd do Now, I'm just missing you
How I wish, I wish that I could hold you now I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you Be with you somehow
I know, I know you're in a better place Even though I can't see your face I
know you're smilin' down on me Sayin' everything's okay
And if I make it out, this thug life See you again someday I wish, I wish, I
wish I wish, I wish, I wish
Ever since this money come, it's been nothing but stress Sometimes I wish that
I could just trade in my success Y'all look at me and say, boy, you've been
blessed But y'all don't see the inside of my unhappiness
Man, I swear this shit gets heavy like a ton That's why you hear me shootin'
this real shit off like a gun I wonder how my friends would treat me now If I
was iced up with a Bentley and a house
That's why fake-ass niggas get fake-ass digits And fake-ass players get a real
player hatin 'em 'Honey Love' goes platinum and y'all ass come round But y'all
don't wanna raise the roof until my shit is goin' down
And now you hear my songs the radio is playin' Oh, I can't believe my ears And
what everybody is sayin' Boy, I tell you folks don't know the half
I would give it all up just to take one ride With you And how I used to hoop
off in them to tournaments With you And how I used to club hop on weekends With
you Your family called the morning of the tragic end Damn, my condolences
I wish that I could hold you now I wish that I could touch you now I wish that
I could talk to you Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place Even though I can't see your face I know you're
smilin' down on me Sayin' everything's okay
And if I make it out this thug life See you again someday I wish, I wish, I
wish I wish, I wish, I wish
Voices in my head been tellin' me to come to church Say, the Lord is the only
way for you to stop the hurt Dreamin' of windows, black-tinted like a hearse
But wakin' up to life sometimes seems worse
And all I ever wanted is to be a better man And I try to keep it real with my
homies, man Want me to save the world, I don't understand How did I become the
leader of a billion fans
And now you hear my songs the radio is playin' Oh, I can't believe my ears And
what everybody's sayin' Boy, I tell you folks don't know the half
I would give it all up just to take one ride With you How I used to street
perform on Friday With you And how I'd go to church on Easter Sunday With you
Instead of y'all throwin' them stones at me Somebody pray for me
Oh, I wish that I could hold you now I wish that I could touch you now I wish
that I could talk to you Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place Even though I can't see your face I know you're
smilin' down on me Sayin' everything's okay
Oh, I wish that I could hold you now I wish that I could touch you now I wish
that I could talk to you Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place Even though I can't see your face I know you're
smilin' down on me Sayin' everything's okay
Oh, I wish that I could hold you now I wish that I could touch you now I wish
that I could talk to you Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place Even though I can't see your face I know you're
smilin' down on me Sayin' everything's okay
Oh, I wish that I could hold you now I wish that I could touch you now I wish
that I could talk to you Be with you somehow
