Baby, we been knowing each other for a long, <br>
long time for somethin' like this to just go and break up everything. <br>
<br>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br>
Here we are, just sittin' here <br>
Knowin' we're all alone <br>
My Rolley's lookin' at me <br>
Sayin' it's time to get it on <br>
You know what I want <br>
And baby, I know what you need <br>
So stop hesitatin', girl <br>
And give your love to me. <br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br>
All I really want is to love you, babe <br>
Make your body feel like heaven, babe <br>
I just wanna satisfy ya, babe <br>
That's all I want, that's all I want <br>
I just wanna give ya somethin', babe <br>
Just wanna keep it comin', babe <br>
I just wanna make you happy, babe <br>
That's all I want, that's all I want. <br>
<br>
<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br>
Though the fireplace is burnin' marshmallows just right <br>
To who it may concern <br>
You won't be comin' home tonight <br>
Body parts that he DON'T kiss <br>
Girl, I will kiss for you <br>
Just put this CD on the repeat <br>
And let me pamper you. <br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat Chorus]</i><br>
<br>
<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br>
Now the swimmin' pool's out back <br>
Come on and skinny dip, baby <br>
Eat breakfast in the morning <br>
That'll be complements of me <br>
In the middle of the night <br>
There's no need for morning here <br>
So hold your pillow tight <br>
Cuz I wanna do it again and again. <br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat Chorus]</i><br>
<br>
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br>
(Til the sun comes up) <br>
Baby, we'll be makin' love <br>
(And when the sun goes down) <br>
Still we won't have enough <br>
Take this love to you <br>
I will take care of all you need <br>
Baby, lets asure <br>
I just wanna set you free, free. <br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat Chorus til fade]</i>
