All hope was gone
Hard to hang on
Hard to be strong
Was blind, could not see
Nothing but walls in front of me And inside no peace
And the mountains seemed Impossible to climb until
You stood on the front lines You led the way out of the darkness We didn't go
astray You were ready to die for our sake And that takes a soldier's heart
Oceans so deep Uphill so steep But still we believe And when the road was too
far to travel Heroes you came and carried us there
And the mountains seemed Impossible to climb until
You stood on the front lines You led the way out of the darkness We didn't go
astray You were ready to die for our sake And that takes a soldier's heart
And so our flag was still there All because you decided to care
You stood on the front lines You led the way out of the darkness We didn't go
astray You were ready to die for our sake And that takes a soldier's heart
You stood on the front lines You led the way out of the darkness We didn't go
astray You were ready to die for our sake And that takes a soldier's heart
You stood on the front lines You led the way, out of the darkness You could
have let us go astray You were ready to die for our sake And that takes a
soldier's heart And that takes a soldier's heart
