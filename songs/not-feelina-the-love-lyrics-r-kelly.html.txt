Lately you've been actin' strange towards me, baby
And your heart, it seems to grown straight cold
You used to laugh at everythin' I said, baby
Now you play me like my jokes are old, yeah
And girl, we used to talk about everythin' Like dancin' 'til when we're old and
gray And all those photographs I took, yeah You don't give me that same look,
yeah When I ask you, you say everythin's okay
Well, I'm not feelin' the love no more And though I see you standin' there I
can't find you anywhere I'm not feelin' the love, girl, no more, babe Tell me
who the, what the, where did we go wrong?
Feels like I'm livin' all alone in this big old house 'Cause girl, you're
distant and your words are few, oh It's like battle of the silence, you've won
this war 'Cause it seems I'm just a ghost to you, a ghost, babe
And girl, we used to talk about everythin', everythin', babe Like makin' love
'til we're old and gray And all those photographs I took You don't give me that
same look And when I ask you, you say everythin's okay
Well, I'm not feelin' the love, babe, no more, no more, baby And though I see
you standin' there I can't find you anywhere I'm not feelin' the love, girl, no

would do it 'til the mornin' light Girl, reminisce on all the little secrets we
can
