Oh yeah, ooo, ooo
Well, well
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Listen girl, you want me but he needs you
Yet you're tellin' me that everything is cool Tryin' to convince me baby to do
as you say Just go along and see things your way
And keep it on the down low Whispering nobody has to know We can keep it on the
down low Whispering nobody has to know
Secret lovers is what you wanna be While making love to him girl, you're
silently calling on me What is a man to do in a situation like this? I feel
there is something that I, I don't wanna miss
Keep it on the down low Nobody has to know Keep it on the down low Nobody has
to know
Beautiful you are but you're his by far Comin' by my way, drivin' his fancy car
Making plans to be in my life forever Tell me, tell me that we'll always be
together
Keep it on the down low Nobody has to know Keep it on the down low Nobody has
to know
Listen babe, I won't whisper a word Nobody, nobody How could you go so long, so
long? Baby, oh oh
