I wanna see your body, I wanna feel your body
I wanna touch your body, I wanna kiss your body
I wanna freak your body, I wanna sex your body
Theres nothing like your body, your body
It's like a jungle atmosphere and we're two monkeys baby It's like we're on a
vine the way we're swingin it baby See, you're a tiger girl the way you're
scratchin me I'm a lion in this jungle I'm a king
Girl, I got you so wet, it's like a rain forest Like Jurassic Park except I'm
your sex-a-saurus baby You and me hoppin like two kangaroos Rattlin and
moanin out here in these woods
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ah ah ah ah Those are the sounds I wanna hear When you're
moanin in my ear Girl you're singin to me Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ah ah ah ah You
got me locked up in your cage of ecstasy And I don't wanna be free
Cause it's wild like a zoo And that's the way I like it baby Crazy me and you
Makin' love like we was just two heated animals Baby come and lay with me in my
jungle
Ooh, I swear I'm about to go Turn your body around and beat the skins like it's
a bongo A thousand birds up out the tree, girl, like a swarm of bees That is
how it's gonna be climaxin', you and me
Touch the root of your soul Let Mother Nature take control Over us is rain and
leaves So come on girl let's plant these seeds, yeah
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ah ah ah ah Baby those are the sounds I wanna hear When you're
moanin in my ear, singin Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ah ah ah ah You got me locked up in
your cage of ecstasy And I don't wanna be free
Cause it's wild like a zoo And that's the way I like it baby Crazy me and you
Makin love like we was just two heated animals Baby wont you come and lay in
my jungle? Y'all don't understand
Like two cheetahs runnin' free African butterflies to me You're my safari
fantasy Girl this is heaven to me

Like the wildlife I'm doin' you baby, I'm doin' you baby You're doin' me baby,

Wild like a zoo And that's the way I like it baby Crazy me and you Makin' love

don't wanna break free
'Cause this is wild like a zoo Just the way I like it baby Crazy me and you

jungle
