Somebody just look back over your life and<br>
See where he brought you from<br>
How many of you know? <br>

Now I was in a real bad abusive relationship<br>
Knowing that, that was no way for me to live<br>
A young girl like me, raised up in a good family<br>
Way too young to endure such misery<br>
And every night I cry myself to sleep from all the pain<br>
And the more I prayed for sunny days it seemed to rain<br>
(He hit me) at any given time<br>
(He hit me) no reason at all<br>
(He hit me) so so hard<br>
(He hit me) my God, sometimes I'd fall<br>
Mama asked what happened to me<br>
And I'd take up for him<br>
She said that devil's a liar<br>
And pray get rid of him<br>
And now I'm going to school<br>
Hitting those books<br>
I'm doing fine<br>
He's out my life<br>
I'm not confused<br>
Got peace of mind<br>
Man I tell you<br>
<br>
Prayer changes (it changes)<br>
Prayer changes (oh it changes)<br>
Prayer changes (I'm a witness that)<br>
Prayer changes things (said I know)<br>
Prayer changes (it changes)<br>
Prayer changes (it changes)<br>
Prayer changes (I'm a living witness that)<br>
Prayer changes things<br>
<br>
I was a freshman in college and uh<br>
I had just made it on the basketball team<br>
I had all the skills it took to make it<br>
But on my grades I would get nothing but all D's<br>
And the coach came to me <br>
And had a talk with me about my career<br>
Said if you don't get your grades up<br>
I'm gonna have to sit you down this year<br>
Man as tough as I was I broke down and cried<br>
'Cause everybody knows me<br>
Knows that basketball is my life<br>
(Algebra) I studied hard<br>
(Chemistry) I gave my all<br>
(Calculus) oh my God<br>
(English) so many flaws<br>
Playing ball didn't look to good for me<br>
My future, could not see<br>
I had lost all my beliefs<br>
And gave up on all my dreams<br>
Then I went to church on Sunday<br>
And the pastor began to preach<br>
It was like he was talking to me<br>
When he said I can do all things<br>
In Christ that strengthens me<br>
And for me that was enough<br>
Now that I went from a D<br>
All the way to an A plus<br>
I tell you prayer changes things<br>
<br>
Prayer changes <br>
Prayer changes (prayer)<br>
Prayer changes (it changes things)<br>
Prayer changes things (oh)<br>
Prayer changes (said it changes)<br>
Prayer changes (things)<br>

<br>
Me and my wife had a few problems<br>
We thought that nothing could solve them<br>
Listening to family members and so called friends<br>
Man I tell you that's just how the devil creeps in<br>
We were separated at least for a month or two<br>
She was wilding in the clubs<br>
And I was out there doing wrong too<br>
And we would walk around the house<br>
Putting each other down<br>
I mean right in front of the kids<br>
We would curse each other out<br>
Then I was in a bad accident<br>
And almost lost my life<br>
And guess who was there for me<br>
My wife<br>
Now ain't it funny how He makes a way<br>
When we said there was no way<br>
I'm out the hospital and back at home<br>
Planning another wedding day, I tell you<br>
<br>
Prayer changes (it changes)<br>
Prayer changes (prayer changes)<br>

Prayer changes things (things, I'm a witness that)<br>
Prayer changes (change)<br>

Now all of these things were happening in one family<br>
But that's okay, cause there's nothing God can't achieve<br>
I don't care what the problem in your life may be<br>
Cause who the Son sets free, is free indeed<br>
And if you didn't know, now you should know<br>
All you have to do is take this family life for example<br>
Now Mom and Dad are married again<br>
Four kids now, cause they just had twins<br>
Little sister all grown up now<br>
She's a lawyer, married with one child now<br>
Two years, big brother's out of college<br>
And man he's got his hands full<br>
Blessed with skills, blessed with knowledge<br>
Now he's playing for the Chicago Bulls<br>
