<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
I decided to stay home tonite<br>
I decided I'ma treat you right<br>
I decided to be there for you<br>
Decided to be on my P's and Q's<br>
I decided to give up my friends<br>
Decided I'ma take you out weekends<br>
Decided to give you a reason to trust<br>
These are decisions that I make for love<br>
<br>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br>
Enough is enough no more running around<br>
(Searchin' for what's right here at home)<br>
Because my luck is 'bout to turn around<br>
(And I just can't keep doin' you wrong)<br>
Girl I take it for granted that you will be here always<br>
(Tired of this ego trip)<br>
'Cause soon you'll be searchin' for another man<br>
And I just can't have that happen to me<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
<br>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br>
<br>
Now I've had about all that I can stand no more<br>
(I'm turnin' in my playa's card)<br>
See I'm retirin' from the secret life I chose<br>
(Cause I just can't keep breakin' your heart)<br>
It was silly of me to be the way that I was<br>
(First was blind, but now I see)<br>
Baby, soon you'll be sayin' I'm fallin' out of love<br>
And I just can't let it happen whoa whoa I<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
<br>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br>
<br>
When tha morning comes, you see the sun will shine on you and me<br>
Was on my way to losin' you, until' I found reality<br>
So cast away your doubts and fears, cause from now on I'll be right here<br>
For always<br>
Forever more, I decided<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus & Bridge 2]</i><br>
<br>
Girl I'm going to dump my friends<br>
Yes I will<br>
Truly I will<br>
We are going to be together on the weekend<br>
Whoa, whoa<br>
See these are the decisions I made for love<br>
For the two of us<br>
Get up off this bull and rebuild your trust<br>
Yeah, yeah, oh noooooo, whoa<br>
There will be<br>
No more cheatin'<br>
No more creepin'<br>
No more fuckin'<br>
No more sneakin'
