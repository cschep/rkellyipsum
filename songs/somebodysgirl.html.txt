<br>
<i>[R. Kelly + (Jay-Z)]</i><br>
Somebody's girl is at this party (woo!)<br>
Shakin that ass to this (uh-huh)<br>
Somebody's girl is at this party (woo!)<br>
Drink that glass of Cris' (that's right)<br>
Somebody's girl is at this party (uh)<br>
Sittin in V.I.P.<br>
Somebody's girl (yeah) is at this party (that's right)<br>
And she's comin home with me<br>
<br>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br>
Ummmmmm.. I don't mean no harm<br>
But your boy young Hov' got a mean ol' arm<br>
Got all the young ladies wanna lean on him<br>
And I don't turn them away, I'm like - bring them on<br>
Now - where's her man is not my concern<br>
It's not what I'm worried about, I'm just tryin to hurry her out<br>
Clear her whole area out<br>
And bring this whole party little nearer to my house<br>
Now - where's her spouse?  I don't know<br>
So, I don't ask, I don't probe<br>
I just - get in 6, get out on Rov'<br>
Let her, sip on Cris', go out on tours<br>
Now - back at the lab, I'm actin bad<br>
Cause the, pool is warm, a booze is on<br>
Just a - select few, the fools are gone<br>
It's slow jams and the grooves is on, groove on<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus: R. Kelly]</i><br>
Somebody's girl is at this party<br>
Shakin that ass to this<br>
Somebody's girl is at this party<br>
Drink that glass of Cris'<br>
Somebody's girl is at this party<br>
Sittin in V.I.P.<br>
Somebody's girl is at this party<br>
And she's comin home with me<br>
<br>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br>
Uhh, is it my fault they call me young heat rock<br>
Hardhead, go through walls like sheet rock<br>
And she's comin with me, when the beat stop<br>
When the party is done, I party with hon<br>
Now - is it my fault you neglect your broad<br>
and she wanna party with me, no ex at all?<br>
No ex-boyfriend, no ex involved<br>
Just the highway exit that we exit off<br>
And I - fall back, I let her talk<br>
I inquire sometime, I admire her mind<br>
I - like her wit, I'm lovin her shoes<br>
I'm a alternative rap, I'm playin the blues<br>
I'm a thorough street nigga never breakin the rules<br>
And her man's shortcomin is turnin me into somethin<br>
that of which she has never seen<br>
So she wanna crossover where the grass is green, knahmean?<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
<br>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br>
The moral of the story if you love your bitch<br>
you better - hold your hoe, hug your bitch<br>
You better - slow your roll, trick some bread<br>
When she wanna go out, you like Craig and 'em said<br>
"See ya when I see ya," now she's callin me up<br>
And I'm like, "Geah, of course I wanna chill"<br>
Now she with the real, and you all fed<br>
Like, "I'ma crack her motherfuckin fo'head!"<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
