Dear God, bring our P.O.W.s home
An' bring our brothers on the lockdown home
Amen
Jeah, it's the nigga from the back blocked
On everybody laptop, sling cracked top Hov, hit this nigga from da shower Hold
a note like da guy who said da British is comin'
My nigga, Kell, oh, yeah, da niggas is comin' Get out ya good dishes or
somethin', like it's Thanksgiving, niggas Hov an' none other than da R An'
without further a due, like Freddy get ready, it's
Whatever happened, Lord? Don't pass me by 'Cause whenever I did wrong, it was
Your name I cried I heard You forgave over an' over again But when I found out
I love You, You became immune to my sins
Laid wide awake in da middle of my sleep I see dead people an' sometimes it's
me, Lord I never wanted to be a thug father I only wanted to be a son of a
father
That's how it sounds inside Worse than da war in Iraq, when it's me against I I
gave up da weed an' somehow I'm still high Three years still seein' them three
guys, Lord
Sometimes I don't know what You want from me But I do know You know what I want
from You Give it to me, come on, take away this Hennessey Take away me runnin'
da streets, stop people from rapin' me Take away all this jealously an'
prejudicy
Lord, You said it was better place I grew up around pimps, hustlers, hoes an'
project gates It's hard to believe in what I can't see I got to get this money
an' feed my family
Whatever it did to you, it guides my life Dear Lord, don't let me die tonight
But if I shall before I wake, I shall, I say It's been a good run from hoodlum
to outin' da states
How could one who made so much foul mistakes Still be allowed to have a smile
on my face? How whatever da case, I'm glad it wasn't murder In a town you never
heard of, from a nickel plated burner
Now my life straight like a perm Tried to take da spot I earn Muthafucka,
better learn
It's Hov, it's the nigga from the back blocked On everybody laptop, sling
cracked top Kell, hit this nigga from da shower Hold a note like da guy who
said da British is comin'
Hov, oh, yeah, da niggas is comin' Get out ya good dishes or somethin', like
it's Thanksgiving, niggas Kell an' none other than da R An' without further a
due, like Freddy get ready, it's
Lord, hear me out, got a few more things to say These demons be chasin' me like
everyday Nah, my life on crutches, never say I'll never walk again But da Devil
is a lie 'cause I believe within'
That You're da reason that I'm still here Even though I don't act like it Even
though I hear my callin' an' fight it Fools do me so wrong, it's hard to stay
righteous Pimpin' was allowed to happen, I'd hide it
Believe me, Lord, I want You Got money an' fame but still it just won't do
Sometimes I don't like who I am When I look in da mirror, my reflection is
Uncle Sam
An' every night I have these weird dreams That a preacher trapped inside of me
wake up an' can't breathe I feel like it's twenty of me Goin' twenty different
directions on a one way street, Lord
I got houses, money an' cars An' met every single superstar I got da whole
music industry sold But it still don't matter, when I'm gone an' my casket
closed
Whatever it did to you, it guides my life Dear Lord, don't let me die tonight
But if I shall before I wake, I'd accept my fate I did what I did, my heart was
in da right place
I guess, so I can live it, put food on my plate You must still love me not to
let it in by three that day Well whatever da case, I'm glad it wasn't murder In
a town you never heard of, from a nickel plated burner
I guess I'm not finished wit my journey Please forgive me for my sins Shit, I'm
still tryna learn me
It's Hov, it's the nigga from the back blocked On everybody laptop, sling
cracked top Kell, hit this nigga from da shower Hold a note like da guy who
said da British is comin'
Hov, oh, yeah, da niggas is comin' Get out ya good dishes or somethin', like
it's Thanksgiving, niggas Kell an' none other than da R An' without further a
due, like Freddy get ready, it's
Many men have come an' gone in these streets Walked alone in these streets,
waitin' to hear from You Oh, Lord, wrap your arms around da hood Lift every
peace from war, bring our soldiers home, let us pray
