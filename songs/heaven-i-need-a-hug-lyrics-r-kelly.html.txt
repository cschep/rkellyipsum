Dear Mama, you wouldn't believe what I'm goin' through
But still I got my head up just like I promised you
Every since you left your baby, boy's been dealin' with
Problem after problem, tell me what am I supposed to do
See, I get lost sometimes, don't understand this place Look in the mirror
sometimes and see a troubled face And then my tears roll down and hit the sink
Then I hold my head up high I hope the man upstairs can hear my cry
All these questions deep inside my mind Like if Jesus loved me why He leave my
side, mama I'm still tryin' to get the answer why You were young, 45, and you
had to die
I'm always tryin' to help people out And it's them same people tryin' to take
food out my mouth
(Fo' real though) It seems like the more money I make (Fo' real though) The
more drama y'all try to create (Fo' real though) And through I try to move into
the positive (Fo' real though) The more y'all don't wanna let me live
When will you realize that I don't owe you nothin' Need to get up off your butt
and go get your own somethin' I'm pullin' on my hair to keep from snappin' off
Fools ride up in my camp and be actin' off
Somebody out there please pray what I'm talkin' 'bout Still young tryin' to
figure it out I
Heaven, I need a hug Is there anybody out there willin' to embrace a thug
Feelin' like a change of heart And all I really need is a sign of a word from
God
So shower down on me Wet me with your love I need you to take me And lift me
up, oh yeah
I gave 13 years of my life to this industry Hit song or not, I've given all of
me You smile in my face and tell me that you love But then before you know the
truth, you're so quick to judge me
That's alright, go ahead, keep talkin' 'Cause I'm a hold my head up high and
keep walkin' And reach for the sky, focus on the plan Rescue the kid with his
paper and pen
And this is for the homies that we lost Yo', we cannot forget y'all, so the
hats come off We pour a little liquor out for the memory I know y'all up there
sittin' on chrome in them pearly streets
The street survivors before careful, stay alive I'm prayin' for your families,
I hope you pray for mine
(Fo' real though) Used to be a time you wished me well (Fo' real though) It
hurts to know you wanna see me fail (Fo' real though) And don't forget I kept
you out of jail (Fo' real though) Where's my arms when you needed to be held
They turn they backs on you, who was there believin' Who said your troubles
were only for a season In church together tryin' to pick up all the pieces And
now you betray me I bind you in the name of Jesus
Somebody please pray what I'm talkin' 'bout Still young tryin' to figure it all
out
Heaven, I need a hug Is there anybody out there willin' to embrace a thug Girl
I can change a heart And all I really need is a sign of a word from God
(Please shower down) So shower down on me Wet me with your love (Yeah) I need
you to take me and lift me up Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Man, I tell you it's enough to make you wanna give it up Thank God for my fans
'cause through it all they show me love
To my sister and to brothers Tell me why can't we just try to get along with
one another And stop hurtin' one another, fightin' one another Man, I pray to
God He get my family back together
Let me see what wanna see, just to blind me All of these luxuries, wine and
dining And then you push me out in front to get behind me Then you sat me up by
blessin' me to bind me
I'm a grown man with kids now, stakes are high Gotta go to church now to avoid
the fight Frankly, y'all to keep it real I'm just tired Dreams of bein' dead,
but the Devil is alive
(Fo' real though) Church folks, you need to stop judgin' (Fo' real though) Or
you will be the first to be judged (Fo' real though) And women stop dependin'
on us men (Fo' real though) And start dependin' on the man above, feel me
And as for Robbin', here's what I need to do Get rid of them clowns and get
myself a whole 'nother crew And media, do your job But please just don't make
my job so hard
Somebody please pray what I'm talkin' 'bout I'm still young tryin' to figure it
all out
Heaven, I need a hug Is there anybody out there willin' to embrace a thug
Feelin' like a change of heart And all I really need is a sign of a word from
God
So shower down on me Wet me with your love (Shower down on me now) I need you
to take me (Please) And lift me up, yeah, yeah (Said I'm callin' on)

Feelin' like a change of heart And all I really need is a sign of a word from
God
