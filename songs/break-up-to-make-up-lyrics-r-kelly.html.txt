the Chris T on with the crease in the middle Plus a fresh cut and the freezin
icicles On my wrist, on my hand, that's when shit hit the fan
Said, "You never spend timey, what's up with that?" Translated it means Hit it

her heartbeat

Sex so intense, all that's on my mind It ain't feel this good since the very
first time I'm pullin her close, she's pullin away I'm tryin to kiss her mouth

had to wait But oh! I know just where your hot spot at You can not deny that,
so do not try that, I do not buy that
