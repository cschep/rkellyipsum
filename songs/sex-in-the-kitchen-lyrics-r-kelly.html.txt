Girl you're in the kitchen
Cooking me a meal
Something makes me wanna come in there and get a feel
Walk around in your T-shirt
Nothing else on Strutting pass, switching that ass while I'm on the phone
Cutting up tomatoes, fruits and vegetables and potatoes Girl, you look so sexy
while you're doing the damn thing I want
Sex in the kitchen over by the stove Put you on the counter by the buttered
rolls Hands on the table, on your tippy toes We'll be making love like the
restaurant was closed
How would you like it, baby? (How would you like that?) Tell me right now
pretty baby (Hey man, I'm gon call you back)
Girl you're in the kitchen, chillin' in your robe I'm sayin' to myself, she
better go put on some clothes Tickling and teasing, doing that little dance
Girl, you gon make me lay you down and give it to you one mo 'gain
Sex in the kitchen over by the stove Put you on the counter by the buttered
rolls Hands on the table, on your tippy toes We'll be making love like the
restaurant was closed
Sex in the kitchen over by the stove Put you on the counter by the buttered
rolls Hands on the table, on your tippy toes We'll be making love like the
restaurant was closed
Girl I'm ready to toss your salad While I'm making love, girl I'll be feasting
Girl you're in the kitchen sweating up a storm The oven's on 500
So you know the kitchen's warm Girl you know just how to get into a brother's
mind 'Cause here we are still in this kitchen Doing it for the third time
Sex in the kitchen over by the stove Put you on the counter by the buttered
rolls Hands on the table, on your tippy toes We'll be making love like the
restaurant was closed
Sex in the kitchen over by the stove Put you on the counter by the buttered
rolls Hands on the table, on your tippy toes We'll be making love like the
restaurant was closed
