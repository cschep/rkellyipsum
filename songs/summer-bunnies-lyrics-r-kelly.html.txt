Girl, you know, you knock me out
You're a real girl with your looks now baby
Girl you know, you knock me out
Summer bunnies drive me crazy
Summer bunnies drive me crazy Summer bunnies drive me crazy Summer bunnies

1, 2, 3, 4 it's time for me to jet Where you goin' off to, the beach, that's a
bet It's summertime so it's time to get a summer These summers, goes and I
won't call them, whores
'Cause in the 90's you gotta respect the ladies So step up to 'em and say, We
love you sweet Sadie That's how you get your true mock on but Brothers be
steppin' up poppin' that sad song
Hey don't I know you from somewhere? Can we go somewhere to be alone? I pull up
in the lot, pop the trunks make their heads bob And it's sunny so it's time to
get a summer bunny
Summer bunnies drive me crazy Summer bunnies drive me crazy Summer bunnies
drive me crazy Summer bunnies drive me crazy
It's five o'clock and my voice code is 22 So beep, beep, beep It's time for me
to make a move I'm on my way to a picnic
But I wanna be early, fool So I can catch the new bunnies comin' in Like the
old school
Strollin' the block so I can check the scenery The sun plays, the day is
feelin' good to me I can just smell the funky beats You know the flavor in
between the sheets
I told My boy Big Al, said Just keep it straight He said, I know I got a
novelty to validate So who's the bunny lookin' sweet like a honeycomb? He
said, No my brother, you got to get your own
Summer bunnies drive me crazy Summer bunnies drive me crazy Summer bunnies
drive me crazy Summer bunnies drive me crazy
This party is packed, word to the mother I love it when there's three bunnies
to one brother And wine coolers is what I'm packin' And when I get my buzz on
is when I start bunny-jackin'
Jackin' fools for their bunnies 'Cause I'm the K, the E, the double L, the Y
They wanna get with me and the PAs in the house So check, check, check it out
My stomach is growlin' so it's time to get mine on Some soul food, cool Aid and
you know it's on I hate to eat and run but I'm out my homie Been invited to a
block party, so we roll up in all our style With the brothers yellin', summer
bunnies
Summer bunnies drive me crazy Summer bunnies drive me crazy Summer bunnies
drive me crazy Summer bunnies drive me crazy
Let's break it down You're lookin' real good but your looks are like a baby
You're lookin' real good but your looks are like a baby You're lookin' real
good but your looks are like a baby
Girl, you know you knock me out Girl, you know you knock me out Girl, you know
you knock me out Girl, you know you knock me out Girl, you know you knock me
out Girl, you know you knock me out Girl, you know you knock me out Girl, you
