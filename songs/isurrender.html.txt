Yeah I know, y'know, what a calling is<br>
I mean we all have a calling in our life, I believe<br>
You know I'm from the dirt man<br>
I come up in these streets, went without eatin', you know what I'm sayin'?<br>
Saw my Mom go without eatin'<br>
I got tired of that I had to go out there<br>
In them streets and hustle, you know?<br>
I mean you know what I'm sayin'?<br>
I mean it's easy for y'all to say, y'know (I surrender)<br>
Surrender your life, you know what I'm sayin'? (I surrender)<br>
Give your life to God and all that<br>
Y'know, that's good and I believe in God (I surrender to you Lord)<br>
But when you got bills at your front door all the time<br>
You know what I'm sayin'?<br>
Kids screamin' "Daddy, Momma, where the food at?" (I surrender)<br>
Man it makes it kinda hard to believe in (I surrender)<br>
Y'know, and have faith in something that you can't see (I surrender to your Lord)<br>
Even though you wanna believe<br>
Y'all just gonna have to just pray for me<br>
You know what I'm sayin'? 'Cause uh...<br>
<br>
Constantly my mind and my heart is racing (yeah)<br>
All by myself trying to solve all these problems I'm facing (oh yeah)<br>
Looking to man trying to find hope (uh-huh)<br>
But man will never know the depth of my struggles (oh)<br>
I was depending on myself (on myself)<br>
To give myself a hand (wow but)<br>
But when depending on myself (I...)<br>
Fell time again (that's why)<br>
And that's why I'm standing here alone (all alone)<br>
With no one else<br>

But everything I seemed to try just made it worse (ohh)<br>
And every road that I'd go down there were no signs (signs)<br>
Destination lonely with no peace of mind (yeah, ohh)<br>
I was depending on myself (on myself)<br>
To give myself a hand (but when)<br>
But when depending on myself (I would fell time and time again)<br>
Fell time again (that's why)<br>
And that's why I'm standing here alone (standing all alone)<br>
With no one else<br>
