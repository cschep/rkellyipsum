Heard 'em say man wasn't made to fly
And when he wanted to go to the moon,
They said he wouldn't make it past the sky
And with all odds against him
They said he'd never reach his goal Said he didnt have the strength To travel
that long road
But i had a dream I had a dream I had a dream That i made history I had a dream
I had a dream I had a dream Now the dream is real to me
Heard 'em say that the mountain couldn't be climbed And when ever thers an
under dog they count him out everytime Some body say that the storm will
never...... And in the crunch of the game They said that theres no way that
team could win
 But i
had a dream I had a dream I had a dream That i made history I had a dream I had
a dream I had a dream Now the dream is real to me
When the battle seems lost And all your strength is gone Just know that the
winds are faithful In carrying you home Just believe in the power The power of
Love
I had a dream I had a dream I had a dream That i made history I had a dream I
had a dream I had a dream Now the dream is real to me x2
