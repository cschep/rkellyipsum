I can see the colors of the rainbow
And I can feel the sun on my face
I see the light at the end of the tunnel
And I can feel heaven in its place
And that's the sign of a victory That's the sign of a victory
I can feel the spirit of the nations And I can feel my wings riding the winds,
yeah I see the finish line just up ahead now And I can feel it rising deep
within
And that's the sign of a victory And that's the sign of a victory
Now I can see the distance of your journey And how you fought with all your
might You open your eyes to global warming And through it all, you sacrificed
your life
That's the sign of a victory, hey That's the sign of a victory
Oh, if we believe, we can achieve anything Including the impossible, this I
know So let's lift up our heads, yeah, and raise the flag, yeah And scream like
you want to win, now let the games begin
That's the sign of a victory, yeah That's the sign of a victory, yeah That's
the sign of a victory, oh That's the sign of a victory, yeah
That's it, when you keep on fighting After you lost your strength That's the
sign of a victory, yes, it is
When darkness is all around you You still find your way That's the sign of a
victory Oh, you got the victory, sing
Come on and sing Lift up your voice and sing Stand up, oh yeah, stand up Common
