Who's the worlds greatest?
Who's the worlds greatest?
The worlds greatest
I am a mountain
I am a tall tree, oh I am a swift wind Sweepin' the country I am a river Down
in the valley, oh I am a vision And I can see clearly
If anybody ask you who I am Just stand up tall Look 'em in the face and say
I'm that star up in the sky I'm that mountain peak up high Hey, I made it I'm
the world's greatest And I'm that little bit of hope When my backs against the
ropes I can feel it I'm the world's greatest
I am a giant I am an eagle, oh I am a lion Down in the jungle I am a marchin'
band I am the people, oh I am a helpin' hand I am a hero, oh
If anybody asks you who I am Just stand up tall Look 'em in the face and say
I'm that star up in the sky I'm that mountain peak up high Hey, I made it I'm
the world's greatest And I'm that little bit of hope When my backs against the
ropes I can feel it I'm the world's greatest
In the ring of life, I'll rein love And the world will notice a king When there
is darkness I'll shine a light And you'll use the success you'll find in me
I'm that star up in the sky I'm that mountain peak up high Hey, I made it I'm
the world's greatest I'm that little bit of hope When my backs against the
ropes I can feel it I'm the world's greatest
I'm that star up in the sky I'm that mountain peak up high Hey, I made it I'm
the world's greatest I'm that little bit of hope When my backs against the
ropes I can feel it I'm the world's greatest
I'm that star up in the sky I'm that mountain peak up high Hey, I made it I'm
the world's greatest I'm that little bit of hope When my backs against the
ropes I can feel it I'm the world's greatest
It's the greatest Can you feel it? Say the greatest Can you feel it?
I saw the light At the end of a tunnel Believe in the pot of gold At the end of
the rainbow And faith was right there To pull me through, yeah Used to be
locked doors Now I can just walk on through
It's the greatest Can you feel it? Say the greatest Can you feel it?
I'm that star up in the sky I'm that mountain peak up high Hey, I made it I'm
the world's greatest I'm that little bit of hope When my backs against the
ropes I can feel it I'm the world's greatest
