Yo, this Tone the referee, knawhatimean?
An' I'm about to bring y'all some history
We got the Best of Both Worlds
An' I got the Get Fresh Crew, Doug Fresh
One, two, three, come on
Mirror, mirror on the wall Whose is the freshest of them all? I love 'em all
but none of y'all is Doug E. as me An' the boy, Kelly with the suicide doors,
fuck 'em all
We got hits like a thirty shot clip When we throw it in the air, everybody hit
the floor Holla at your boy, boys When we boys, so we bringin' out them toys
I ain't a lame on them Dana Dane's We give you nightmares, when the year
change, we change Nigga, we right here, we can go bank for bank We can go clip
for clip, nigga, chain for chain We can go bitch for bitch, got a pretty young
thing That I keep by my hip, like my celly that rings
Meetin' Michelle at the hotel While Jay an' Tone on the way to the after party
Got the ladies sayin', Oh Best of Both Worlds an' we rock the club,
youknowhatimsayin? Boy HO, Kells, we not playin' Losers lose, so when we does
what we do, we win
An' win again, like deja vu Then we win again, like M.J. do Three-peat, then we
retreat to waters that's blue Young Scrappy, that's what grown man do, let's
move
In this arena, arena All we wanna see is them hands up, hands up This is for
them hustlin' boys an' girls It's the return of Best of Both Worlds
In this arena, arena All we wanna see is them hands up, hands up This is for
them hustlin' boys an' girls It's the return of Best of Both Worlds
Well once upon a time, they left the glove an' the star, kid He swore he was
the man but he was nothin' but garbage Let me re-phrase that, bubblin' with
pride Did have skills but he was ugly inside
Instead of uplift folks, sittin' on the nonsense Hurtin' people feelings like
he didn't have a conscience Like 'I love you', when he's hittin' that stash
Then degraded, the shorty, like he didn't have class
Even let a gay Jew man tack his Jheri Then got the nerve to call the next cat a
fairy Swindlin', forgot the God above him Finally fan base trinklin' down to
nothin'
No concern for his estate, though, was yearnin' for a break Bitter an' evil,
didn't learn from his mistake The moral of the story is 'Don't be a pair of
knickers Be good, boys an' girls an' you can be as great as Rick is'
In this arena, arena All we wanna see is them hands up, hands up This is for
them hustlin' boys an' girls It's the return of Best of Both Worlds
In this arena, arena All we wanna see is them hands up, hands up This is for
them hustlin' boys an' girls The remixes, the remix yo, track masters, cmon
My baby momma's robe, my rent is overdue It took half the pay an' now my life
is filled with rainy days But I stashed some dough, how much you'll ever know
It's Doug Fresh, Slick Rick, Kells an Jay-Z
