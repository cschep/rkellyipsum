Hit it hard from the back<br>
Roll around on the front<br>
I know you've heard a lot of tracks<br>
But 12 Play is what you want<br>
Just let me call the studio<br>
Then we can go all night<br>
Girl I hope you can hang<br>
Cause I'm horny as hell tonight<br>
<br>
One<br>
Taking off your Secrets with my teeth<br>
Two <br>
Slightly rough to let you know it's about to get kinky<br>
Three<br>
Blind your eyes, then I walk you to my bedroom<br>
Four<br>
Now open your eyes <br>
Surprise you've entered twelve play two<br>
<br>
Stop<br>
We need to catch our breath<br>
We've been going for a while<br>
It's been about two hours<br>
And we're still going round for round<br>
The water's getting cold<br>
And the movie's going off<br>
This is how we do in TP-2<br>
<br>
Five <br>
I'm about to take you for a ride<br>
Now feel it come inside<br>
Six<br>
Baby it's as hard as a brick<br>
Tell me can you feel this sh, sh, sh<br>
Seven<br>
That's when to slow it down<br>
Cause I'm not ready to<br>
Eight<br>
We're almost at the peak<br>
Cause I'm feeling tingly<br>
<br>
Now flew your body like, what (what, what)<br>
It's like diamonds with the cut (cut, cut)<br>
The hottest out of your friends<br>
The way you take it from me<br>
Girl you put it on me like draws<br>
Moaning when you talk<br>
I'm about to tear your shit out<br>
New millennium style<br>
<br>
Nine<br>
Lookin' you in your eyes<br>
As I'm about to do that thing<br>
Ten<br>
Then on down to your thighs <br>
I'm gonna make you scream<br>
Eleven<br>
Now put your body on top of me<br>
I'm about to grab your waist<br>
Twelve <br>
Now quick before we get to thirteen<br>
Set it on my face
