Bright nights, street lights in a city that never sleeps
Loud music and talks, people where all the party seems
I saw a girl and I notice that she noticed me
We sipped mojitos, then she told me all about her dreams
Then we made love in a taxi cab It reminded me of a dream I had Now the
memory's like a photograph, ooh babe And I can't get her out of my head, oh
Made love in a taxi cab, taxi cab, taxi cab Made love in a taxi cab, taxi cab,
taxi cab Made love in a taxi cab, taxi cab And I surely know she's there
I come alone, I come alone, oh, that's what she said I come alone, I come
alone, oh
Looking at the rearview she said to me, let go and be free Then she told the
driver mind his business and then went there on me Then I told her we're just
15 minutes from my home But she didn't stop, she kept saying it feels so
incredibly wrong
And we made love in a taxi cab It reminded me of a dream I had Now the memory's
like a photograph, ooh, baby girl And I can't get her out of my head, oh
Last night, made, made love in a taxi cab, taxi cab, taxi cab Last night, made
love in a taxi cab, taxi cab, taxi cab Last night, made love in a taxi cab,
taxi cab Last night and I surely know she's there
And it all happened so soon, girl I didn't even get a name, she took control
and had her way Oh I, and it was like a hotel room, yeah We're taking a gamble
what people love to pay
Oh, we made love in a taxi cab It reminded me of a dream I had Now the memory's
like a photograph, baby And I can't get her out of my head
Oh, last night made love in a taxi cab, taxi cab, taxi cab Last night made love
in a taxi cab, taxi cab, taxi cab Last night made love in a taxi cab, taxi cab
Last night and I surely know she's there
Last night made love in a taxi cab, taxi cab, taxi cab Last night made love in
a taxi cab, taxi cab, taxi cab Last night made love in a taxi cab, taxi cab,
taxi cab
Then we made love in a taxi cab, taxi cab, taxi cab It reminded me of a dream I
had Now the memory's like a photograph, baby And I can't get her out of my
head, ooh babe
