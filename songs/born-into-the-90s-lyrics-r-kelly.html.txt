Song: Burn It Up
Lyrics:

Ohhhhhhhhhhhh ohhhh ohhhhhh ohhhhhhhh
Burn it up
Girl make it hot like the roof is on fire
Burn it up
Girl the way you dance you are my one desire
Come on


When you roll it
I can't control it
And when you throw it
It's hard to catch it
And when you shake it
I pray you don't break it
And when you drop it
Girl I cannot take it
Something about the way you move (hey!)
Sweat is dripping all over you (hey!)
The way you let the beat take over you (hey!)
Baby don't stop keep it going make it hot (hey)
The way you put your back in motion (mama)
Oh I love you the way you freakin' it (mama)
You got me comin' out of VIP (mama)
Cause you look like the girl in my dreams (mama)
I step up in the club first thing I see is you freakin' it
Your eyes and body language tells me you want me to hit it
Well I say girl
Back that thing up to me
Closer (ohhhh)
A little closer (work it)
Come on and shake it on me now (work it)
Come on and work it on me now (work it)
Girl it's getting heated now (work it)
It's time to put this club on fire now
