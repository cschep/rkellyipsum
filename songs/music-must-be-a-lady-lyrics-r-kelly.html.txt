Music must be a lady
The way it makes me love to me
Me, ooh, you, music, music
I'm so amazed by your choice of melodies
That you used on me, Lady Music
When we make love it's like we're making love With the same key, music, music
must a lady 'Cause of the way you sing your melody Woman, I'm overcome by your
sexual energy
Miss conductor, orchestration means just how to please you In this room, music,
I do for you
I hear a drum roll as we lay, oh When you grace my stage I can't find the words
to say, except Music must be, must be a woman, oh You're my anthem, you're the
reason why I dance
Music, Mrs. Music, Miss Music I wanna make your body Sing songs of joy and
happiness Write your words in my bed
Miss Music said I'll never fall in love, never ever fall in love Now here I am
in love, so, so, so in love with you Miss Music, this love making is so unique
 beat
Music, said I celebrate you And I honored you and I salute you And I sing my
heart out to you
Music, 'cause you deserve it And I would like to do some things to you
Music, so get ready, Miss Music Oh, get ready, darling 'Cause I'm about to add
harmony to your life A love making duet, just to be precise, babe
Music, hello sweet soprano, Miss Music I want you to meet Mister Tenor And I
love your music As a matter of fact I'm quite a big fan
Music, Mrs. Music, Miss Music, Mrs. Music Music
