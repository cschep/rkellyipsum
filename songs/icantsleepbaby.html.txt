Girl I must have been crazy <br>
To say that it was over<br>
I had to be a fool <br>
To yell out we were through<br>
And now I'm all alone <br>
And feeling down and out baby<br>
When I never <br>
Meant for this to end<br>
It was so so crazy of me<br>
Sometimes we say things that we really don't mean<br>
Well I'm sorry baby<br>
Bring your lovin' back to me<br>
<br>
<i>[1]</i> - I can't sleep babe<br>
I can't think babe<br>
I can't live babe<br>
Without you in my life <br>
I can't go on babe<br>
This is my song baby<br>
Don't wanna do nothin' if I go away baby<br>
And I can't do nothin' if you're not around<br>
<br>
Though I must admit <br>
That things got out of hand<br>
When you told me<br>
That he was just a friend<br>
I should of had my trust in you <br>
From the very start darlin'<br>
Cuz I never meant for this to end<br>
How can we get it back again?<br>
Oh sometimes a man can say things <br>
That he really don't mean<br>
Well I'm sorry baby <br>
Bring your lovin' back to me<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
Baby can we meet somewhere <br>
And talk about it<br>
Oh baby, can we work it out<br>
I'm not gonna let you go my baby <br>
Before I let you know that I<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1 until fade]</i>
