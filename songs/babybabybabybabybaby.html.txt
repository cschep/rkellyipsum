<i>[Spoken]</i><br>
Anything you want baby<br>
Anything your heart desires<br>
Because you've been there for me<br>
(Truly there for me)<br>
I'm gonna give it to you<br>
Listen<br>
<br>
<i>[1]</i> - Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby <br>
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby <br>
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby <br>
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby <br>
<br>
Anything you want, I'm gonna give it to you girl<br>
Because when I was down you always lifted up my head<br>
Gonna show you all the love I have in store for you<br>
I gotta let you know that I am truly down with you, oh<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
Like no other homie, you are always there for me<br>
The only girl I know that truly satisfies my needs<br>
When I was down and out you were hangin' by my side<br>
And now that I am holdin' you, you'll always be in my life, oh<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
Taking me to church on Sunday morning, girl is cool<br>
Because I found a blessing and some happiness in you<br>
Whenever there is darkness, G you brighten up my day<br>
I thank the Lord for you because you understand my ways, oh<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
When I look at you I see the breaking of the day<br>
I'm mighty glad to know that Heaven sent your love my way<br>
It's something about the way you do your lovin' when you do<br>
And now until forever, baby, I'll be lovin' you, oh<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
<i>[Spoken]</i><br>
You were always there for me - you know what I'm saying?<br>
So today I'm taking you out - buy you something real nice<br>
I'm gonna be here for you until the day becomes the night<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
From the bottom of my heart, yes promise me we'll never part<br>
Let's say a prayer together, say a prayer together baby<br>
Can we say a prayer together baby<br>
Heavenly Father which art in heaven<br>
I pray that you keep this love together<br>
This is my prayer, baby, baby, baby, I love you
