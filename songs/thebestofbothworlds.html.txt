This is for my niggaz down bottom and them hustlers on twenty-two's<br>
Single parent mothers in the hood is who I'm talkin to<br>
I know it's rough in the ghetto but let me walk witchu<br>
Talk witchu, uh-huh, yeah-hea<br>
And for the ones who put you down and said you wouldn't make it<br>
But you still held your ground and came up out that basement<br>
In the memory of those that we lost, it's deicated<br>
We miss y'all, uh-huh, yeah-hea<br>
<br>
<i>[Jay-Z + (R. Kelly)]</i><br>
This right here this whole album's..<br>
in the memory of all our fallen soldiers (uh-huh)<br>
we lost along the way (ohhhhhoooh) knahmsayin, ghetto to ghetto<br>
City to city, worldwide, we got y'all, y'knahmean?<br>
(Ghetto America) This album right here represents strength<br>
(Ohhhh! Yeahhh) Strength in our people, understand it<br>

Cock-suckers can not touch us, the block love us<br>

<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br>
We mastered this, don't you know<br>
I eat beef and breathe acid, weak bastards<br>
We copped and we crash it<br>
Then we cop again cause we are classic<br>
Let me speak for ya R we "Scarface" re-enacted<br>
"The Godfather" trilogy re-casted<br>
But it's real like we grievin for Aaliyah with the masses<br>
But I hope my boy Dash get to see it when he passes<br>
I feel her soul when the Lee passes<br>
When the wind blows, it's almost like I see her in the Hamptons<br>
Even more reason to be up in them mansions<br>
Laid back, feet up in the hammock, I'ma live for ya<br>
Big too, 'til they put me in the grave<br>
I'ma floss 'til they toss me a Bed-Stuy parade<br>
'Til Chi-Town make a nigga Mayor for a day<br>
In the memory of Joanne Kelly, let us pray<br>
<br>
<i>[R]</i> Both worlds... welcome to the best of both worlds
