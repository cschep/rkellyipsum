Baby, what we gon' do?
I need you to talk to me
Come on
Suddenly, I feel the need to pull you close to me
But I don't know, if it's what you want, baby Girl show me some kind of sign
That tells me that you're mine, all mine, baby
It's gettin' awfully warm, off in this room I'm gettin' head up off your sweet
perfume And I'm ready, to explore every part of you Girl I'll take my clothes
off first, then now you
Ooo ooo ooo, baby Baby, tonight we'll be, naked Ooh, ooh, ooh
I'll take a stroll through your garden of love And show you so, so much Just
take my hand and believe in our future Gettin' you open like matchin' doors
Sheets and covers on the floor And if the bell should ring, we won't answer
Girl, I'll take my clothes off first, and now you Wanna tell, what I want from
you
Baby tonight I wanna see you naked So dim the lights Baby tonight I wanna see
you naked I wanna see you tonight
Baby tonight I wanna see you naked Oh babe, oh babe, your body's the reason for
sight Baby tonight I wanna see you naked Ohh ohh, naked
