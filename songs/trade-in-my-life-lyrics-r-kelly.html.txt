Sittin' here wonderin' how did things go wrong Every night askin' myself what
happened to our happy home Will I ever see you again? I need to know my friend

such a happy pair, oh, yeah I cannot believe we've thrown it all away Tell me

down And I need you around, trade

you, for you Trade in my life for you Trade in my life for you, yes
We both know that we made a vow Said we'd always be together And that our love
would endure, yes But now you're gone and I'm all alone But I need you here and
