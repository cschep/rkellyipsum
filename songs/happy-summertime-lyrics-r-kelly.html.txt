Happy summer time niggas, ahh, yeah
We rolling, we rolling, we rolling, we rolling
Drop up in the summer time
And we rolling through the block with the sun shining and I
Just wanna ride, I just wanna ride
Go to the mall and I hit the gym Have a pool party, gets some chicks, all swim

Sun shining like California Come here girl let me push up on ya Can we do how
we do in a China hard day Pull you to the club 'cause it's Friday
Let's drink and hit the dance floor DJ put the summer jam on Big chips at the
bar spending GT with the wheels spinning
