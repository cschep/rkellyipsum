As I look into my life <br>
Searching for that paradise<br>
<br>
Oh Lord will you help me, find me<br>
Take this crazy ghetto past of mine<br>
And put it all behind me<br>
Look down on the ghetto man<br>
And change his mission<br>
And put it in the hearts<br>
Of many to stop confusion<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
My sistas, brothas<br>
Let's put these hands together<br>
We need to stop chokin' on the truth<br>
And start smokin' on a plan man<br>
Love and respect that woman<br>
And bring her happiness<br>
I'm talkin' to the ghetto<br>
For each other we should help<br>
While our babies are dying in the street<br>
We've got to be saying to ourselves
