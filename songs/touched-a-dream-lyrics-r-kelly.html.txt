Girl, you just don't know
Last night was incredible
Yes
Check it out
Last night I felt the skies Open up and rain down Heaven Last night I felt the
sun The moon and stars come together
Last night I heard an Angel Speak to me and said "Us forever" And while we were
makin' love I saw visions of a tropical river, last night I
Touched a dream (You were here with me, last night I) Touched a dream (Girl,
you fulfill my fantasy)
Touched a dream (Said we rewrote the book of love-makin' history) Touched a
dream (Last night you brought my dreams to reality)
Now last night, I coulda sworn I saw an eagle spread his wings Last night I
heard a mass Quietly lift their voice and sing
Last night I saw the world Livin' in peace and harmony While we were makin'
love Felt my soul being set free, last night
Touched a dream (You were here with me, last night I) Touched a dream (You
fulfill my fantasy)
Touched a dream (I said we rewrote the book of love makin' history) Touched a
dream (Oh yeah, girl, you brought my dreams to reality)
After the rain comes the rainbow The sun will shine now even though it's cold
Oh, yes it will And mother nature guarantees it, yeah
Jumped the mountain and touched the sky Over the sea baby, we can fly When we
make love I see the flowers the trees, the birds, the bees Last night I touched
a dream
Touched a dream (Yeah, you were right here with me) Touched a dream (A dream)
Touched a dream (You fulfill my fantasy oh baby, yes you did)) Touched a dream
(Said we rewrote the book of love-makin' history)
Touched a dream (Girl, you brought my dreams to reality, yeah) Touched a dream
(There's nothin' when you are lying next to me)
Touched a dream (You fulfill my fantasy, yes you did) Touched a dream (And baby
we rewrote the book of love-makin' history)
If I ever I have a dream A vision of you right there with me I know you're my
love making queen And I am your love making king Let no man or woman come
between What God has given you and me
The laws of reciprocity The gift of amorocity Provided us with food to eat
Fills our vacancies Put together the perfect chemistry Forever anniversaries
You're the root to my tree I'm a branch you're a leaf The apple carrying my
seed Fall, winter, summer, spring That's why I ain't gon' let the Devil Steal
my joy from me 'cause I done
Touched a dream Touched a dream Touched a dream
