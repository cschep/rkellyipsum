Uh, huh, I remember when I back in the days
When I ain't got shit
Now that I got shit, niggas wanna keep up shit
But it's all good
Watch me do this shit

lock down Voice cry hot sounds tied down cop twisters Shop lifters with Benini
schemes Smoke greenie green candyman up in cabrini green Some cats I know like
to splurge on they wrists But my man karate man cut the nerves out his fist But
