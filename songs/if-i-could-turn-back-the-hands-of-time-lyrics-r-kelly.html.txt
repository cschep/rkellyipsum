How did I ever let you slip away?
Never knowing, I'd be singing this song some day
And now I'm sinking, sinking to rise no more
Ever since you closed the door
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time Then my darlin', you'd still be
mine If I could turn, turn back the hands of time Then darlin' you, you'd still
be mine
Funny, funny how time goes by And blessings are missed in the wink of an eye Oh
why, oh why should one have to go on suffering? When every day I pray, please
come back to me
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time Then my darlin' you, you'd be mine
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time Then my darlin', you still be mine

And you had enough love for the both of us But I, I, I did you wrong I admit I
did But now, I'm facing the rest of my life alone, whoa
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time Then my darlin' you, you'd be
mine, whao If I could turn, turn back the hands of time Then my darlin', you
still be mine
Oh, I'd never hurt you (If I could turn back) Never do you wrong (If I could
turn back) And never leave your side (If I could turn back the hands) Turn back
the hands
There'd be nothing I wouldn't do for you (If I could turn back) Forever honest
and true to you (If I could turn back) If you accept me back in your heart, I
love you (If I could turn back the hands)
(If I could turn back) That would be my will (If I could turn back) Darlin' I'm
begging you to take me by the hands (If I could turn back the hands)
I'm going down, yes I am (If I could turn back) Down on my bended knee, yeah
(If I could turn back) And I'm gonna be right there, until you return to me (If
I could turn back the hands)
(If I could turn back) Just turn back that little clock on the wall (If I could
turn back) Then I'd come to realize how much, I love you (If I could turn back
the hands)
(If I could turn back) Love you (If I could turn back) Love you (If I could
turn back the hands) Love you
Love you (If I could turn back) (If I could turn back) (If I could turn back
the hands)
