Girl, I want to be alone with you
Just to see what you can do
Ooh, you're dancing all over me
Baby, this is like some kind of fantasy
The way you move, you're teasing, girl So tonight I want you in my world
There you go again, girl, on my mind See you in my dreams all the time Ooh,
baby girl, you're so fine Standing in front of me
Now will you wind for me, slow wind for me Oh, you wind for me, slow wind for
me Will you wind for me, slow wind for me Oh, you wind for me, slow wind for me

Girl, the time has come to show and prove I've seen enough, I wanna feel the
truth Put your voodoo on me, babe Kiss my lips and curse me, babe Show me how
you do your magic, babe Lead me to your secret jungle, babe

Now will you wind for me, slow wind for me Oh, you wind for me, slow wind for
me Will you wind for me, slow wind for me Oh, you wind for me, slow wind for me
