Yeah, like I was saying I ain't ya know what
I'm not tryin' to say things to hurt you, you know what I'm saying
I don't wanna hurt you baby, just sometimes you do things
That push me to say things I don't wanna say
You know what I'm saying?
You know I love you, you know I care about you This time, you just brought it
on yourself Yo, check it out
Now I should a been more man about the way things went down Especially since we
been dealin' for like seven years now I've been slowly, slowly bringing you
down No conversation, no good sex in a while
But still you search and find a way to love me somehow Even though I ride you
still trust me somehow Got my faces, some ice and a tie Slowly, slowly, slowly,
slowly goin' down
(I don't mean it) When I holler at you (I don't mean it) When I say that we're
through (I don't mean it) What I'm takin' you through (I don't mean it) Baby
(I don't mean it) Said I'm sorry (I don't mean it) Can you find a way to
forgive me (I don't mean it) Said I went to church this morning (I don't mean
it) I don't mean it
Running around here talking about how I'm a big player now Hidden in corners
blinging out our share Kelly makin' hits now Thinking about this industry and
how I put it out You were there for me when I used dish rags for ties
There's times that I didn't hear you I was talkin' too loud When I didn't come
home I was hanging with the crowd Whenever we fight I try to win every round
Can you find a way to forgive me now?
(I don't mean it) 'Cuz I don't mean it (I don't mean it) When I holler at you
(I don't mean it) Whenever I say we're through (I don't mean it) Whoa
(I don't mean it) Can you find a way to forgive me? (I don't mean it) Ooh baby,
I (I don't mean it) I went to church this mornin' (I don't mean it) Ooh I don't
mean it
Father, can you help me? What do you need from Me? I broke up with my girl and
I'm feelin' kinda lonely I been watching you from Heaven, Kelly you been so
demanding You need to read My word, son and get some understanding
But I been busy with my music Stop making excuses recognize the love she gives
And try not to abuse it Is it too late to get her back? Not as long as I'm a
fact Well Father, show me a sign That will make her mine
(I don't mean it) I don't mean it (I don't mean it) Whenever I say we're
through (I don't mean it) Or whenever I holler at you (I don't mean it) Ooh ooh
ooh ooh ooh
(I don't mean it) Ooh baby, ooh baby (I don't mean it) See what was straight is
now stone (I don't mean it) Because I took you for granted, oh (I don't mean
it) Whoa
(I don't mean it) I don't mean it (I don't mean it) Whoa you should know I
don't mean it (I don't mean it) I put it on my life (I don't mean it) Believe
me I pay the price
(I don't mean it) When I was down and out (I don't mean it) You reached out
your hand (I don't mean it) I've learned it takes a good woman (I don't mean
it) To raise a man
(I don't mean it) Oh, I love you baby (I don't mean it) Oh oh oh I love you
baby (I don't mean it) Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh (I don't mean it)
