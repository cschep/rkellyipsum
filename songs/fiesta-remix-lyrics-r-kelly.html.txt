After the show it's the after party
Then after the party it's the hotel lobby
And after the Belve' then it's probably Cris'
And after the original it's probably this

Remix with the homie from the Midwest side Game recognize game, hoes do too
It's the new 2 Live Crew, I suppose you knew So thugs, pop yo' toasters but
don't approach us or Bullets'll chase you like Moet mimosas
Catch us both coasts, racin' twin Porsches Boxes with glocks that'll pop ya to
make ya ghost-es Whoever come closest you've been warned But niggaz don't get
the picture till the weapons is drawn Make your way backstage, baby girl it's
