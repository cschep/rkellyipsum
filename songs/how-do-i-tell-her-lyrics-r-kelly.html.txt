How do I tell her that I'm going away?
When I know that she'll be begging me to stay
And how do I tell her that the time has come to part?
When she's, she's gonna take it so hard
I don't wanna break her heart I don't wanna see her cry, no 'Cause I promised
her forever That I'd be by her side so
So how do I tell her, how do I tell her Tell her goodbye? Oh yeah
How do I tell her that my path has gone and changed? When I know that her heart
won't be able to stand the pain, oh no And how do I tell her that I'm moving on
with my life When she's just gonna break down and die, oh
I don't wanna break her heart, no I don't wanna see her cry, no When I promised
the girl forever I'd be by her side so
So how do I tell her Tell her, tell her goodbye? Oh yeah, whoa
Listen, she's been forever faithful, honest and true, yes, she has My God, this
has gotta be the worst thing that I ever had to do How, how, how, how, how,
how?
How do I tell her, oh, oh, that the time has come to part? When I know that
she's gonna take it so very hard, yes, she is
Said, I don't wanna break her heart I don't wanna see the little girl cry When
I promised her forever, oh, oh That I'd be by her side
How do I tell her Tell her, tell her goodbye, bye, bye, bye? Oh baby, bye and
whoa
How, how do I tell her? How do I tell her goodbye, baby Won't somebody tell me
How do I tell the girl
Bye, bye baby, bye, bye baby Bye, bye baby, bye, bye baby Bye, bye baby, bye,
bye baby Bye, bye baby, bye, bye baby, ooh
