Dear God.. how can I explain myself?<br>
<i>[J]</i> Oh God bless me indeed<br>
When I'm so confused<br>
<i>[J]</i> Enlarge my territory<br>
<i>[J]</i> Place your love and protection over me at all times<br>
Help me!<br>
<i>[J]</i> Keep me away from evil<br>
Somebody answer me! <i>[echoes]</i><br>
<i>[J]</i> Allow me not to cause pain<br>

Police in the background, screamin put the thing down<br>
That's how hard I was trying to put my thing down<br>
Si-rens ringin out, old ladies screamin out<br>
All this attention for me and I'm barely sixteen now<br>
.. it's feelin like a dream now<br>
Handcuffed, roughed up, I'm tossed in the bing now<br>
I'm lyin next to fiends now, that's the end of the story<br>
Let me bring y'all niggaz back to the very first scene now<br>
December 4th, a child is born<br>
Before I knew it, had my pops trousers on<br>
That's how we do it when the man of the house is gone<br>
You either, stand or fall, I chose to stand<br>
The hawk outside, so I blow my hand<br>
It's a cold cold world but I overstand<br>
Tryin to stay focused but I feel hopeless damn<br>
Can't cope with bein broke, I'm a man - c'mon<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus: R. Kelly]</i><br>
Son don't let these streets, get the best of you<br>
I will be right by your side, when you goin through<br>
Son just don't let it (just don't let it)<br>
Just don't let it (just don't let it)<br>
Just don't let it (just don't let it)<br>
.. get the best of you<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br>
Late one night I was, rollin the streets<br>
Just, thinkin about what's goin on with me and<br>
trapped in this thug life, tryin to break free but<br>
this thug life just keeps callin me<br>
I'm livin life way too dangerously<br>
I'm drownin in my misery<br>
Looked in the mirror, there's my enemy<br>
Cause poppa never was a part of me<br>
Take one step at a time, mama said<br>
Sweet memories still remain in my head<br>
All of my life been lied to, misled<br>
Voices be like, "Don't you wish you was dead?"<br>
No ground to place my feet<br>
I feel the fire under me<br>
A way out is all I need<br>
Somebody, answer me!<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus + ad libs]</i><br>
<br>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br>
Now the only thing left is more spirit to roam free<br>
.. cause ain't no goin home for me<br>
It's a cold cold world but I blew my hand<br>
A true first cause I knew that man<br>
I knew what he would do if I didn't draw first<br>
And I couldn't stand the thought of my momma steppin foot inside a church<br>
All I try to do is try to get up out the dirt<br>
Guess he's tryin to do the same, told me get up out his turf<br>
I wanted to talk to him, but that shit'd never work<br>
We was cut from the same cloth and what was under his shirt was his<br>
momma's rent, his young brother's clothes<br>
My nephew's food, and with that I suppose<br>
.. and with that I froze<br>
Now my life is frozen in time behind these iron folds<br>
And this story is told, for young soldiers<br>
who never choose the life we chose<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus + (ad libs)]</i><br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br>
Tears in my eyes as I look up, I'm tryin to<br>
hold back my pride but reality is screamin<br>
Gotta get a job cause mo-mma also screamin<br>
Streets are just like drugs, and it's like I'm out here fiendin<br>
Forget all the hits in the industry, cause<br>
ain't no exceptions in this game for me, look<br>
Neither God or my enemies, I<br>
choose God cause he understands, this<br>
young man with a thuggish heart<br>
Whole world in his hands but still torn apart<br>
Like I'm so close, but it's still so far<br>
Nightmares of me in a swervin car, ohhh<br>
No ground to place my feet (my feet)<br>
I feel the fire under me (heyyy)<br>
A way out is all I need (all I need)<br>
Somebody, answer me!<br>
<br>
