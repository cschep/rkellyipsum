As I look into my life searching for that paradise
Oh Lord will You help me, find me?
Take this crazy, crazy past of mine and put it all behind me
Look down on the ghetto man and change his mission
And put it in the hearts of many to stop confusion
As I look into my life searching for that paradise (We need to mourn for love)
My sistas, brothas let's put these hands together (As I look into my life
searching for that paradise) We need to stop chokin' on the truth and start
smokin' on a plan man
Man love and respect that woman and bring her happiness (As I look into my life
searching for that paradise) I'm talkin' to the ghetto for each other we should
help While our babies are dying in the street we've got to be saying to
ourselves (As I look into my life searching for that paradise)
