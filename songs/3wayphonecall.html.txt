<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
Hello<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
Hey little brother<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
Hey sis how you doing?<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
Fine, what's going on with you?<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
Oh nothing much<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
Got your message from earlier this afternoon<br>
And something just didn't sound right<br>
And so I'm calling you back to check on you<br>
How you holding up?<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
Oh everything is fine<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
You know I don't believe you<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
Whatcha saying? You think I'm lying?<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
I'm not saying it, but I know you<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
How you know me?<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
Cause you're my brother<br>
And therefore I can tell<br>
When something is troubling you<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
Ok Ok, I give you that<br>
Nothing's wrong, I take that back<br>
There is something on my mind<br>
But sis, I don't want to waste your time<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
But I done told you time and time again<br>
Whatever you're going through<br>
You can come and talk to me<br>
And I will say a prayer with you<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
But I done prayed and prayed night and day<br>
I still can't seem to find my way<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
Rob that ain't nothing but the devil telling you<br>
That you're washed up and you're through<br>
But sister's here to let you know<br>
Boy you're gonna make it through<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
Sister, do you really believe that I can rise again<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
Yes, and not only that, Rob, God will forgive you for your sins<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
Can you tell me what to do?<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
Well first you gotta believe the truth<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
Sometimes it's hard to believe in Him<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
That's okay because he believes in you<br>
<br>
The winds, the rain<br>
The storm<br>
The weapons that are formed against us (I will survive)<br>
The trying times<br>
The sleepless nights<br>
Just know that faith is with us (and I believe yeah)<br>
Through all of the hills<br>
And valleys roamed<br>
That we must come to (woah)<br>
Walk side by side<br>
Follow the light<br>
And we'll make it through (We'll make it through yeah)<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
So, so what you're saying is believe a little more?<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
Yes, cause faith is the key that will opens up the door<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
What you're saying to me, it's hard to receive<br>
Especially when trouble follows me<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
When we're keeping it real<br>
Robert sometimes<br>
Trouble can follow where you lead<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
Yes sister, I know sometimes, but I...<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
Just wait, let me make a phone call<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
To who?<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
A prayer buddy of mine<br>
She can help you tear down your walls<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
I don't want nobody in my business<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
She's a friend<br>
And besides you need this<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
You know how church folk can be<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
Boy I'm your sister, trust in me<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
Mmm<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
Now hold on<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
Maybe she's gone...<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
No<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
Maybe we ought to just try...<br>
<br>
<i>[Maurice Mahon:]</i><br>
Hello<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
Shh shh, hello, is Kim there?<br>
<br>
<i>[Maurice Mahon:]</i><br>
Yes, I think she's around here somewhere<br>
Hold on<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
Now you just let me do the talking<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
Mmm hmm<br>
<br>
<i>[Kim Burrell:]</i><br>
Hello?<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
Hey girl, how you doing?<br>
<br>
<i>[Kim Burrell:]</i><br>
Hey Kelly<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
My little brother's on the line and needed advice from you<br>
<br>
<i>[Kim Burrell:]</i><br>
Ooh what can I do for you?<br>
Hello?<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
Go ahead Rob, she's talking to you<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
Oh, well, I know you must be very busy<br>
So I'm not going to mess around, nah<br>
Just telling my sister how my life is upside down<br>
And I don't know whether I'm going left or right half the time<br>
Sometimes think I'm gonna lose my mind, you feel me?<br>
<br>
<i>[Kim Burrell:]</i><br>
Mmm hmm... similar to what I used to go through<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
Really?<br>
<br>
<i>[Kim Burrell:]</i><br>
Yes, and sometimes I still do<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
Yeah?<br>
<br>
<i>[Kim Burrell:]</i><br>
See it doesn't matter who you are<br>
Or where you're from<br>
If you struggle, God will use you<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
Amen sister, what you're saying is so true<br>
Rob are you there?<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
Yes, I'm just listening to the both of you<br>
It's so easy to say, but not so easy to do<br>
<br>
<i>[Kim Burrell:]</i><br>
Yes but if you stand the truth<br>
It will free you<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
Oh<br>
<br>
<i>[Kim Burrell:]</i><br>
Just stand strong<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
Stand strong<br>
<br>
<i>[Kim Burrell:]</i><br>
With your head held high<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
With your head held high<br>
<br>
<i>[Kim Burrell:]</i><br>
Said it wont be long<br>
In time he will provide<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
Will he?<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
Yes he will<br>
<br>
<i>[Kim Burrell:]</i><br>
You just stay in the race<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
Just stay in the race<br>
<br>
<i>[Kim Burrell:]</i><br>
And keep on running<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
And down to the end<br>
<br>
<i>[Kim and Kelly:]</i><br>
Cause your day is coming<br>
<br>
The winds, the rain<br>
The storm<br>
The weapons that are formed against us<br>
The trying times<br>
The sleepless nights<br>
Just know that faith is with us<br>
Through all of the hills<br>
And valleys roamed<br>
That we must come to<br>
Walk side by side<br>
Follow the light<br>
And we'll make it through<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
He'll give you peace<br>
In the midst of your storm<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
Sometimes I feel like it's too late for me<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
But he'll never leave you<br>
<br>
<i>[Kim Burrell:]</i><br>
No way<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
You just gotta hang on<br>
<br>
<i>[Kim Burrell:]</i><br>
Hang on<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
Robert say a prayer, keep your head<br>
God will do just what he said<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
Finally I think I get it<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
Yes, that's it<br>
That's the spirit<br>
<br>
The winds, the rain<br>
The storm<br>
The weapons that are formed against us<br>
The trying times<br>
The sleepless nights<br>
Just know that faith is with us<br>
Through all of the hills<br>
And valleys roamed<br>
That we must come to<br>
Walk side by side<br>
Follow the light<br>
And we'll make it through<br>
The winds, the rain<br>
The storm<br>
The weapons that are formed against us<br>
The trying times<br>
The sleepless nights<br>
Just know that faith is with us<br>
Through all of the hills<br>
And valleys roamed<br>
That we must come to<br>
Walk side by side<br>
Follow the light<br>
And we'll make it through<br>
The winds, the rain<br>
The storm<br>
The weapons that are formed against us<br>
The trying times<br>
The sleepless nights<br>
Just know that faith is with us
