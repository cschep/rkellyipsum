Finally the weekend's come <br>
And everything is goin' down<br>
Nine to five and now it's time <br>
For me to get around<br>
Good poppin' ain't no stoppin' everybody's in the mood<br>
Mind blowin' once you feel the music startin' to get to you<br>
Disco nights, party lights, it's all good for me<br>
<br>
<i>[1]</i> - Thank God it's Friday<br>
Party lights, Friday night feelin' right<br>
It's a party<br>
Thank God it's Friday<br>
Party lights, Friday night feelin' right<br>
It's a party<br>
<br>
Throw your hands up <br>
If you're ready to get down and jam tonight<br>
Music's got ya jumpin' <br>
And you're feeling not a care tonight<br>
Keep goin' don't you stop<br>
Just let this volume get in you<br>
Take some time out for yourself <br>
And let this Friday get to you<br>
Disco nights, party lights<br>
It's all good for me<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
Oh God, thank you for Friday<br>
Oh thank you heavenly Father<br>
Oooo so many people lookin', lookin' for the spot<br>
There's a party over here<br>
So many people lookin' for the party spot<br>
If you find it<br>
Let me know and I'll be there until I drop<br>
Valet parking at the club<br>
It lets you know it's Friday night<br>
People swayin', music playin' <br>
And this weekend feels so right, yeah<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
My sistas, enjoy your weekend <br>
And may God bless all of you
