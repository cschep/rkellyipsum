It's the Piper y'all<br>
I just wanna know what y'all are doin' this weekend<br>
Ha, ha<br>
I got somethin' goin' down<br>
And I just want y'all to be there<br>
To share this dream of love<br>
<br>
You're invited<br>
To come and be a part of a<br>
Celebration<br>
On my love train<br>
You don't need nothin'<br>
Come as you are, just<br>
Make sure when I show you love<br>
You show love back the same<br>
<br>
<i>[Pre-Chorus]</i><br>
Uhh, got my shoes, got my hat, got my suit<br>
And I'm ready to go now<br>
Oh yeah<br>
And me and my partner look so good<br>
It's like we about to do a show now<br>
So if you're steppin' come on down<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
Grab your partner<br>
Hit the dance floor<br>
Tonight we'll be<br>
Steppin' into Heaven<br>
Steppin' into Heaven<br>
Grab her hand and<br>
Spin her 'round and 'round<br>
Tonight we'll be<br>
Steppin' into Heaven<br>
<br>
Oh, congratulations<br>
If you're celebratin'<br>
Your anniversary<br>
Or your birthday<br>
Here by yourself?<br>
Then get up and find some one<br>
Because<br>
We don't need no reason to celebrate<br>
<br>
<i>[Pre-Chorus]</i><br>
