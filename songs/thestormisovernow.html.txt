I was in a tunnel<br>
And couldn't see the light<br>
And whenever I'd look up<br>
I couldn't see the sky<br>
Sometimes when I'm standin'<br>
It seems like I done walked for miles<br>
And my heart could be cryin'<br>
Dead in the middle of a smile<br>
<br>
But then I climbed the hills<br>
And saw the mountains<br>
I hollered help 'cause I was lost<br>
Then I felt the strong wind<br>
Heard a small voice sayin'<br>
<br>
The storm is over<br>
(The storm is over now)<br>
And I can see the sunshine<br>
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)<br>
I feel Heaven, yeah<br>
(Heaven is over me)<br>
Come on and set me free, whoa<br>
<br>
Now in the midst of my battle<br>
All hope was gone<br>
Downtown in a rushed crowd<br>
And felt all alone<br>
And every now and then<br>
I felt like I would lose my mind<br>
I've been racin' for years<br>
And still no finish line, oh<br>
<br>
But then I climbed the hills<br>
And saw the mountains (Mountains)<br>
I hollered help 'cause I was lost<br>
Then I felt the strong wind<br>
And then a small voice sayin'<br>
<br>
The storm is over<br>
(The storm is over now)<br>
And I can see the sunshine<br>
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)<br>
I can feel Heaven, yeah<br>
(Heaven is over me)<br>
<br>
Come on and set me free<br>
<br>
Somehow my beginning stepped right in (Right in)<br>
Then faith became my friend (My friend)<br>
And now I can depend<br>
On the voices of the wind<br>
When it's sayin' (Sayin')<br>
<br>
The storm is over<br>
(The storm is over now)<br>
And I can see the sunshine<br>
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)<br>
I can feel Heaven, yeah<br>
(Heaven is over me)<br>
<br>
Won't you come and set me free<br>
Won't you set me free<br>
<br>
The storm is over<br>
(The storm is over now)<br>
And I can see the sunshine<br>
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)<br>
I can feel Heaven, yeah<br>
(Heaven is over me)<br>
Won't you come and set me free<br>
