What's up baby<br>
I know what you're thinking<br>
What did I call you over here for <br>
I wanna take you somewhere<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
Tempo slow, lights down low<br>
Let me take you to a place<br>
Where only love grooves go<br>
<br>
Step into my territory <br>
And let the vibes begin<br>
Don't be afraid<br>
Just let this love groove in<br>
Let the passion lead you to a place beyond<br>
Exploring my bedroom, having freaky fun<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
<br>
All the players go<br>
All the gangstas go<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
<br>
Rules they are so simple, so very simple<br>
As our bodies connect <br>
And those juices start to flow<br>
Makin' sweet love 'til the morning light<br>
And satisfying love's appetite<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus (2x's)]</i><br>
<br>
Baby tell Daddy what it is you want<br>
Come on and unravel those little secrets unknown<br>
Time to taste what love has in store for me<br>
So let's take a sip of this love groove chemistry<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus (3x's)]</i>
