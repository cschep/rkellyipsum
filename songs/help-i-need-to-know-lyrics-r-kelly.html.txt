Chorus:
 You bring me joy
 Night and day
 Girl you and me should getaway
 I got a special hideaway   Where you and me can be alone
Verse 1:  Oooo, baby this love making is so good that I can't picture myself
with no one else  And girl God is good because he put you here just for myself
The way to walk and dress, your smile, your grace and sex  Tonight nothing's
gonna come between us but sex
Chorus:   You bring me joy   Night and day  Girl you and me should getaway  I
got a special hideaway  Where you and me can be alone  Imagine you and me naked


Bridge:  Like a mountain  Girl I'm gonna climb all on top of you
Like a river  I'm gonna be flowing all over you girl
And like a horsey  I'm gonna saddle up a ride you girl    Like a something
Something again
And our bodies shiver  Oooooo
Heaven must have sent your love to me  Cause when I look at you heaven is all I
see    Chorus
