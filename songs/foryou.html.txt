I understand your every needs and how you feel about, the way, he left you.<br>
Take my hand, come go with me.<br>
And let me show you how much Icare about you.<br>
Girl when you need someone...<br>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br>
Girl I'll be right there when you need me<br>
All you have to do is just call me,<br>
I'll be there for you.<br>
Girl it's true.<br>
Only for you.<br>
oh yeah..<br>
If I told you once,<br>
I told you twice, that if you need to cry,<br>
I'll be your shoulder.<br>
Girl I would never say goodbye.<br>
I'll be your miracle, gotta let you know.<br>
Girl if you need someone...<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
<i>[music playing]</i><br>
You need a man who's<br>
(honest)<br>
and<br>
(understanding)<br>
Gotta be<br>
(satisfying)<br>
and someone<br>
(belonging)<br>
girl I'm gonna be<br>
(affection)<br>
and I'm gonna be<br>

Girl you need someone <br>
(dedicated)<br>
I need you to know that I'll be there for you whenever you need me.<br>
<i>[Chorus fade]</i>
