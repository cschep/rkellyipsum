She got some micros, she got a weave wrap
She got it locked up I can smell the beeswax
Now let me pull ya hair(pull ya hair) 3X

Shortie thick is hell, something like a fairy tell
And you treating if you got it so I paid for the nails She told me she was
hungry so I paid for the hairs Her body like a coin flip heads or tails Beep
beep) girl don? t back it up on me, She did it anyway and it felt like a truck
on me Stop teasing hit this dro, and let's get woozy Turn the flat screen off,
girl forget that movie Follow me to the bed room, or we can hit the back of the
mayback It's something like a bedroom, a lot of pillows and head room Hips and
thighs, a nigga trying to see what that xxx do. She said be careful, of her
hair, do. Last chick said that I pulled on her hair too. It's kellys, listen up
all women I sweat weaves out, you should call me Richard Simons,
