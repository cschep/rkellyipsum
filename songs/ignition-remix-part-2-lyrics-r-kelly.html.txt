Now, usually I don't do this but uh
Gone ahead on break 'em off wit a lil' preview of the remix
No I'm not tryin' to be rude
But hey pretty girl I'm feelin' you
The way you do the things you do Reminds me of my Lexus coup That's why I'm all
up in your grill Tryina get you to a hotel You must be a football coach The way
you got me playin' the field
So baby gimme that toot toot And let me give you that beep beep Runnin' her
hands through my 'fro Bouncin' on 24's While they say on the radio
This is the remix to ignition Hot and fresh out the kitchen Mama rollin' that
body Got every man in her wishin' Sippin' on coke and rum I'm like so what I'm
drunk It's the freakin' weekend baby I'm about to have me some fun
Bounce-bounce-bounce-bounce-bounce-bounce-bounce Bounce-bounce-bounce Come on
Now its like murder she wrote Once I get you out them clothes Privacy is on the
door Still they can hear you screamin' more Girl I'm feelin' what you feelin'
No more hopin' and wishin' I'm bout to take my key and Stick it in the ignition

So gimme that toot toot Let me give you that beep beep Runnin' her hands
through my 'fro Bouncin' on 24's While they say on the radio
It's the remix to ignition Hot and fresh out the kitchen Mama rollin' that body
Got every man in here wishin' Sippin' on coke and rum I'm like so what I'm
drunk It's the freakin' weekend baby I'm about to have me some fun
Crystal poppin' in the stretch navigator We got food every where, as if the
party was catered We got fellas to my left, honies on my right We bring 'em
both together we got drinkin' all night Then after the show its the after party
And after the party its the hotel lobby And round about 4 you gotta clear the
lobby Then take it to the room and somebody
Can I get a toot toot Can I get a beep beep Runnin' her hands through my 'fro
Bouncin' on 24's While they say on the radio
This is the remix to ignition Hot and fresh out the kitchen Mama rollin' that
body Got every man in her wishin' Sippin' on coke and rum I'm like so what I'm
drunk It's the freakin' weekend baby I'm about to have me some fun
This is the remix to ignition Hot and fresh out the kitchen Mama rollin' that
body Got every man in her wishin' Sippin' on coke and rum I'm like so what I'm
drunk It's the freakin' weekend baby I'm about to have me some fun
Girl we off in this jeep Foggin' windows up Blastin' the radio In the back of
my truck Bouncin' up and down Stroke it round and round To the remix We just
thuggin' it out
