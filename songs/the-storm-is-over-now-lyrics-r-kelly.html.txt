I was in a tunnel
And couldn't see the light
And whenever I'd look up
I couldn't see the sky
Sometimes when I'm standin' It seems like I done walked for miles And my heart
could be cryin' Dead in the middle of a smile
But then I climbed the hills And saw the mountains I hollered help 'cause I was
lost Then I felt the strong wind Heard a small voice sayin'
The storm is over The storm is over now And I can see the sunshine Somewhere
beyond the clouds I feel Heaven, yeah Heaven is over me Come on and set me free

Now in the midst of my battle All hope was gone Downtown in a rushed crowd And
felt all alone Every now and then I felt like I would lose my mind I've been
racin' for years And still no finish line, oh
But then I climbed the hills And saw the mountains I hollered help 'cause I was
lost Then I felt the strong wind And then a small voice sayin'
The storm is over The storm is over now And I can see the sunshine Somewhere
beyond the clouds I can feel Heaven, yeah Heaven is over me Come on and set me
free
Somehow my beginnin' stepped right in Then faith became my friend And now I can
depend On the voices of the wind When it's sayin'
The storm is over The storm is over now And I can see the sunshine Somewhere
beyond the clouds I can feel Heaven, yeah Heaven is over me Won't you come and
set me free? Won't you set me free?
The storm is over The storm is over now And I can see the sunshine Somewhere
beyond the clouds I can feel Heaven, yeah Heaven is over me Won't you come and
set me free?
Won't you come and set me free Just like, if that guy can see the light,
shinin' Somewhere beyond the clouds If that guy can see the light, shinin' Take
it down, down If that guy can see the light, shinin' The day is going, world is
runnin' The clouds moving, the sun shinin' I made it home, I made it home
Prayin' for a pot of gold
The storm is over now I'am telling you I could see the light Somewhere beyond
the clouds I can feel Heaven over me Heaven is over me Come and set me free
Come and set me free Won't you come and set me free?
