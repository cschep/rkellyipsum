<i>[R]</i> Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus: R. Kelly + (Lil' Kim)]</i><br>
Uh-huh (shake ya body body, move ya body body)<br>
Uh-huh (twist ya body body, switch ya body body)<br>
Uh-huh (dip ya body body, work ya body body)<br>
Uh-huh (any-body body, every-body body)<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br>
Pub-o, drank-o, 'dro plus the Bev-o<br>
Hands in the air-o, holla like echo<br>
Tone's in the dub with, Momo and Poke-o<br>
Tone be like Kujo, I be like Cecil<br>
Fists rockin like "ADRIIIAN!"<br>
We come through like "Superfriends!"<br>
Tick-tock, tick-tock, it's six o'clock<br>
And the party won't stop, bout to hit the IHOP<br>
Got twenty inch mirrors rollin under the drop<br>
So clap that shit up y'all and make it hot<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br>
New York, Chicago, Atlanta, L.A.<br>
Miami crazy like yippie-i-yae<br>
Rude boys in the club smokin on hay<br>
Smoke the choka weed, Cali and the Bay<br>
Real live niggaz - put y'all hands up<br>
Wanna get tossed - drink that liquor<br>
Who's got the industry locked - Kelly and Jigga<br>
Crack my skull - turn that shit up<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br>
We got honies everywhere<br>
Corks off the Cris' poppin everywhere<br>
Partyin hard like we just don't care<br>
The best of both worlds, that shit ain't fair<br>
<br>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br>
This shit ain't fair<br>
I, am, Jay, Hov'<br>
Mami shake ya body body, don't hurt no-body body<br>
It's me in the God-body, R. Kelly the John Gotti<br>
of R&B thug and me I would say I'm probably<br>
the hardest rapper to ever cop on poppy and<br>
put it in a song, ma how could you go wrong ha? ha? ha? ha?<br>
Worse than a armed robbery<br>
Know that I'm armed properly, whenever the arm's rocky<br>
You can go on clockin me, ain't nuttin gon' stop me<br>
High as Allah I be, movin in peace but I<br>
move with the piece, so them, dudes in the streets<br>
will never remove my piece, ha? ha?, got me<br>
Niggaz'll never get me, I never move sloppy<br>
Move with the glock-50, got some Tupac with me<br>
Let's not test my gangsta, just, raise your glasses<br>
Mami, shake ya asses, this is a thug classic<br>
<br>
<i>[Lil' Kim]</i><br>
Make a hole make a hole and let the Queen come past<br>
I come through in the speedboat, with 808's in the glass<br>
Push big things here, bet most of y'all crash<br>
Back to trainin lightweights, you in the wrong weight class<br>
Haters, stay awake, fuck the Harlem Shake<br>
We "Slam" dance like Onyx, check my ebonics<br>
You got, heat nigga you thinkin we won't blaze?<br>
Gotta come hard cause these are the last days<br>
When I, do it I do's it, ain't no more to it (word)<br>
Ask Ice Cube, I puts my back into it<br>
From car dealers to Macy's, to cashiers that brace me<br>
We train like the Navy for whatever the case may be<br>
I pass on the 6, they don't impress me much<br>
I want the bulletproof 7 cause the doors lift up<br>
They pick the best of all girls, so how y'all sound?<br>
I got the best of both worlds, holdin me down<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
<br>
<i>[R]</i> Uh-huh!
