Entrea<br>
Ay, tantas cosas que quiero<br>
Decirte yo quiero <br>
Hacer por ti<br>
But first we must dancce<br>
<br>
Private cotillion style<br>
One lady's fantasy <br>
Trip to Milan tonight <br>
Exclusive shopping spree<br>
Mansions await, your scent <br>
That smells just like treasure <br>
Dining with me in suites<br>
That overlooks the shore<br>
<br>
<i>[1]</i> - As we move, then we touch, then we dip<br>
(Dancin' with a rich man)<br>
As we move, then we touch, then we dip<br>
(Shall we dance, shall we dance, shall we dance)<br>
As we turn, then we stare, then we kiss<br>
(Dancin' with a rich man)<br>
As we turn, then we stare, then we kiss<br>
<br>
Kissing the feet of you<br>
While listening to Bonsois<br>
And your angelic brace<br>
Wearing Victoria <br>
Passionate love with you <br>
Hearing you "Oh, oui oui" <br>
Some antique jewelry from<br>
Kenshire's gallery <br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
And when you elevate<br>
Like visions of grandeur<br>
Mademoiselle and me<br>
Behind the villa doors<br>
Sunsets on yellow sand <br>
That's where we rendezvous<br>
Chapels of Valentine<br>
Is just to name a few<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i>
