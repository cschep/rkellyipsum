Baby, what we gon' do?<br>
I need you to talk to me, c'mon<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br>
Suddenly, I feel the need - to pull you close to me<br>
But I don't know, if it's what you want, baby<br>
Girl show me some kind of sign<br>
that tells me that you're, miiiine, all mine, baby<br>
It's gettin awfully warm, off in this room<br>
I'm gettin head up off yo' sweet perfume<br>
and I'm ready, to explore, every part of you<br>
Girl I'll take my clothes off first, then now you<br>
Ooooooooooo-oo-ooo-oo-ooo-oo-ooo-oo-ooo baby<br>
Baby.. tonight we'll be, naked<br>
Oooooooh, oooooooh, oooooooh, ooooooooh<br>
I'll take a stroll through your garden of love<br>
and show you so so much<br>
Just take my hand, and believe, in our fu-ture<br>
Gettin you open like matchin doors<br>
Sheets and covers on, the floor<br>
And if the bell should ring, we won't answer<br>
Girl I'll take my clothes off first, and now you<br>
Wanna tell, what I want from you<br>
<br>
Baby tonight I wanna see you naked<br>
So dim the lights<br>
Baby tonight I wanna see you naked<br>
I wanna see you tonight<br>
Baby tonight I wanna see you naked<br>
Oh babe, oh babe, yo' body's the reason for sight<br>
Baby tonight I wanna see you naked<br>
Ohhh-ohhh, naked
