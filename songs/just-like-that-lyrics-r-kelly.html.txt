Oh baby, if I could explain the joy I feel
Oh, if I could explain the joy I feel and
Oh, this love makin', baby it's so real and
Oh, like winter time by the fireplace and
Oh, like trapped in walls and it's no escape and
Oh, like a precious jewel with no price tag and Oh, like waterfalls comin' down
on me and Oh, like a tidal wave comin' from the sea and Oh, like a favorite
scene in a big movie
You wanna know how I feel just like that, just like that, baby If you wanna
know how I feel just like that, just like that, baby (If you wanna know)
If you wanna know how I feel just like that, just like that, baby (Oh, just
like) If you wanna know how I feel just like that, just like that, baby
Oh, like you and me makin' history, baby Oh, like a 99th anniversary and Oh,
like a baby when it speaks its first words and Oh, like an uplifting song the
first time heard and
Oh, like a shelter when the storm gets rough and Oh, like a mountain top from
the bottom up and Oh, like an expensive suite at the best hotel and Oh, like a
work of art when it's unveiled
If you wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that, baby (Like that )
If you wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that, baby (Oh, if you
wanna know)
If you wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that, baby (Just like
that, yeah) If you wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that
Oh, like the great blue sky is on a summer day and Oh, like sittin' close in a
small cafe and Oh, like makin' love to someone you love and Oh, like breakin'
up then makin' up and
Oh, like a warm embrace when you come around and Oh, like the sweetest words
when your feelin' down and Oh, like lost inside of a masquerade and Oh, like a
celebration in a big parade and
Oh, like a secret told to the one you trust and Oh, like kissin' you in an all
white tux
If you wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that, baby (If you
wanna know) If you wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that, baby
(Just like that, if you wanna, wanna know)
If you wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that, baby (Just like
that) If you wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that
Like the moon, yeah, when it glows at night (If you wanna know how I feel, just
like that, just like that) And like the sun, oh, yeah when it shines real
bright (If you wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that)
And just like the ocean when the whale jumps high (If you wanna know how I
feel, just like that, just like that, baby) Like an eagle when it soars the sky
(If you wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that) (If you wanna
know how I feel, just like that, just like that)
