This is my song for real, no doubt
Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out
As I walk you to the dance floor
We begin to dance slow
Put your arms around me I'm feelin' on your booty
Hey pretty mama how you doing? Said I'm just in town for the weekend Looking
for a little trouble to get into Baby, tell me what you're drinking And I got
you, ooh
Playas wanna play Ballers wanna ball Rollers wanna roll But I'm taking off
after I dance, oh yeah
This is my song for real, no doubt Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out As
I walk you to the dance floor We begin to dance slow Put your arms around me
I'm feelin' on your booty
This is my song for real, no doubt Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out As
I walk you to the dance floor We begin to dance slow Put your arms around me
I'm feelin' on your booty
Now you're body's got me feelin' like spending With a back room I could come to
live in And your hair weave looking kind of pretty The way you back it up on
me, baby, God have mercy
Playas wanna play Ballers wanna ball Rollers wanna roll But I'm taking off
after I dance, yeah
This is my song for real, no doubt Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out As
I walk you to the dance floor We begin to dance slow Put your arms around me
I'm feelin' on your booty
This is my song for real, no doubt Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out As
I walk you to the dance floor We begin to dance slow Put your arms around me
I'm feelin' on your booty
If it's your birthday then put your hands up You wanna get drunk then put your
hands up And if you got some cash then put your hands up Have your own job, put
your hands up
Playas wanna play Ballers wanna ball Rollers wanna roll Feel so good, say it
again
Playas wanna play Ballers wanna ball Rollers wanna roll But I'm taking off
after I dance, oh yeah
This is my song for real, no doubt Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out As
I walk you to the dance floor We begin to dance slow Put your arms around me
I'm feelin' on your booty
This is my song for real, no doubt Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out As
I walk you to the dance floor We begin to dance slow Put your arms around me
I'm feelin' on your booty
This is my song for real, no doubt Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out As
I walk you to the dance floor We begin to dance slow Put your arms around me
I'm feelin' on your booty ...
