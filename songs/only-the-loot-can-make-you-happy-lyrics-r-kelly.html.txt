Rockland
(In my life)
Uhh, track masters
(You're all I need in my life)
Make money (You're all I need in my life) Duece, duece (You're all I need in my
life)
Uh huh, yo, yo, yo, yo I remember in the days Y'all niggas talking all that
shit about keepin' it real But when it comes to this game I'm a play the field
Rockland had loot before we signed the deal Haters get in the way and catch the
sky like seal We used to use the streets for the football field In church free
lunch was our only meal But now we push whips with Lorenzo Wheels Living it up
in Beverly Hills
You know 9 to 5 was only temporary Now the ladies wanna find tone in a hurry
Got them hittin' notes that Mariah couldn't carry All you player haters going
down like Mary Cop the Rolls Royce a player with a choice Ladies stay moist
from the sound of my voice The lady killers pass the keys to our villas
Rockland, track masters top billers
Only the loot can make me happy (Nothing but the loot baby) Happy (Show me the
loot baby) Happy (Show me the loot)
Only the loot can make me happy (Nothing but the loot baby) Happy (Nothing but
the loot baby) So happy (Show me the loot)
I never thought that I Could make someone like you I felt energized When you
went through my groove I'll never let you go no You're so right for me I've got
to let you know Forever you and me (The Balla's anthem right here)
Only the loot can make me happy (Show me the loot baby) Happy (Nothing but the
loot baby) Happy (Show me the loot baby)
Only the loot can make me happy (Nothing but the loot baby) Happy (Show me the
loot baby) So happy (Show me the loot)
You must be Heaven sent Sent into my life And I compliment you honey, the money
(Nothing but the loot baby) We have a love that's long and true I make you in
many ways I've got to roll with you Each and every day
Only the loot can make me happy (Nothing but the loot baby) Happy (Nothing but
the loot baby) Happy (Uh uh)
Only the loot can make me happy (Nothing but the loot baby) Happy (Nothing but
the loot baby) So happy (Nothing but the loot baby)
You're all I need in my life I don't need no one, I don't need no one but you
You're all I need in my life I don't need no one, I don't need no one but you I
said "You're all I need in my life I don't need no one, I don't need no one but
you You're all I need in my life, I don't need no one I don't need no one but
you"
Only the loot can make me happy (Nothing but the loot baby) Oh happy So happy
(R.Kelly)
Only the loot can make me happy (Black burn trackmatches) So happy (Nothing but
the loot baby) So happy (Nothing but the loot baby) Only the loot can make me
happy Happy, happy
Only the loot can make me happy (Nothing but the loot baby) Happy (Nothing but
the loot baby) So happy
All I need in my life (In my life, in my life) (Nothing but the loot baby) I

loot baby)
