magazine cover check billboards all the others any awards I would get girl you

you got your clothes and then you walk up out the door
I could give a dam* about a hit cause I only wanna be with you and if my job
means there is no more us then I quit cause I only wanna be with you
So take me off the radio no more going to the studio cause none of the ish is
worth losing you naw naw no more hanging with the thugs baby they can have

weight, making demands and acting like I'm God I've been fronting (frontin)

you got your clothes and then you walk up out the door
I could give a dam* about a hit cause I only wanna be with you and if my job
means there is no more us then I quit cause I only wanna be with you
So take me off the radio no more going to the studio cause none of the ish is
worth losing you naw naw no more hanging with the thugs baby they can have
these clubs I dont wanna live this good life without you

I could give a dam* about a hit cause I only wanna be with you and if my job
means there is no more us then I quit cause I only wanna be with you
So take me off the radio no more going to the studio cause none of the ish is
worth losing you naw naw
I could give a dam* about a hit cause I only wanna be with you and if my job
means there is no more us then I quit cause I only wanna be with you
