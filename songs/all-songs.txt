Rob that ain't nothing but the devil telling you That you're washed up and
you're through But sister's here to let you know Boy you're gonna make it
through
Sister, do you really believe that I can rise again Yes, and not only that, Rob
God will forgive you for your sins Can you tell me what to do? Well first you
gotta believe the truth Sometimes it's hard to believe in Him That's okay
because He believes in you
The winds, the rain, the storm The weapons that are formed against us I will
survive The trying times, the sleepless nights Just know that faith is with us
And I believe yeah Through all of the hills and valleys roamed That we must
come to Walk side by side and follow the light And we'll make it through We'll
make it through, yeah
So, so what you're saying is believe a little more? Yes, cause faith is the key
that will opens up the door What you're saying to me, it's hard to receive
Especially when trouble follows me When we're keeping it real Robert sometimes
Trouble can follow where you lead
Yes sister, I know sometimes, but I Just wait, let me make a phone call To who?
A prayer buddy of mine She can help you tear down your walls I don't want

busy So I'm not going to mess around, nah Just telling my sister how my life is
upside down And I don't know whether I'm going left or right half the time
Sometimes think I'm gonna lose my mind, you feel me?
Similar to what I used to go through Really? Yes, and sometimes I still do
Yeah? See it doesn't matter who you are Or where you're from If you struggle,
God will use you
Amen sister, what you're saying is so true Rob are you there? Yes, I'm just
listening to the both of you It's so easy to say, but not so easy to do Yes but
if you stand the truth it will free you
Oh, just stand strong Stand strong With your head held high With your head held
high Said it wont be long In time He will provide
Will He? Yes He will You just stay in the race Just stay in the race And keep
on running And down to the end For your day is coming
The winds, the rain, the storm The weapons that are formed against us The
trying times, the sleepless nights Just know that faith is with us Through all
of the hills and valleys roamed That we must come to Walk side by side follow
the light And we'll make it through
I know He'll give you peace In the midst of your storm Sometimes I feel like
it's too late for me But He'll never leave you No way You just gotta hang on
Hang on
Robert say a prayer, keep your head God will do just what He said Finally I

trying times, the sleepless nights Just know that faith is with us Through all
of the hills and valleys roamed That we must come to Walk side by side follow
the light And know we'll make it through
The winds, the rain, the storm The weapons that are formed against us The
trying times, the sleepless nights Just know that faith is with us Through all
of the hills and valleys roamed That we must come to Walk side by side follow
the light And know we'll make it through

All hope was gone
Hard to hang on
Hard to be strong
Was blind, could not see
Nothing but walls in front of me And inside no peace
And the mountains seemed Impossible to climb until
You stood on the front lines You led the way out of the darkness We didn't go
astray You were ready to die for our sake And that takes a soldier's heart
Oceans so deep Uphill so steep But still we believe And when the road was too
far to travel Heroes you came and carried us there
And the mountains seemed Impossible to climb until
You stood on the front lines You led the way out of the darkness We didn't go
astray You were ready to die for our sake And that takes a soldier's heart
And so our flag was still there All because you decided to care
You stood on the front lines You led the way out of the darkness We didn't go
astray You were ready to die for our sake And that takes a soldier's heart
You stood on the front lines You led the way out of the darkness We didn't go
astray You were ready to die for our sake And that takes a soldier's heart
You stood on the front lines You led the way, out of the darkness You could
have let us go astray You were ready to die for our sake And that takes a
soldier's heart And that takes a soldier's heart

As I look into my life searching for that paradise
Oh Lord will You help me, find me?
Take this crazy, crazy past of mine and put it all behind me
Look down on the ghetto man and change his mission
And put it in the hearts of many to stop confusion
As I look into my life searching for that paradise (We need to mourn for love)
My sistas, brothas let's put these hands together (As I look into my life
searching for that paradise) We need to stop chokin' on the truth and start
smokin' on a plan man
Man love and respect that woman and bring her happiness (As I look into my life
searching for that paradise) I'm talkin' to the ghetto for each other we should
help While our babies are dying in the street we've got to be saying to
ourselves (As I look into my life searching for that paradise)

Song: Burn It Up
Lyrics:

Ohhhhhhhhhhhh ohhhh ohhhhhh ohhhhhhhh
Burn it up
Girl make it hot like the roof is on fire
Burn it up
Girl the way you dance you are my one desire
Come on


When you roll it
I can't control it
And when you throw it
It's hard to catch it
And when you shake it
I pray you don't break it
And when you drop it
Girl I cannot take it
Something about the way you move (hey!)
Sweat is dripping all over you (hey!)
The way you let the beat take over you (hey!)
Baby don't stop keep it going make it hot (hey)
The way you put your back in motion (mama)
Oh I love you the way you freakin' it (mama)
You got me comin' out of VIP (mama)
Cause you look like the girl in my dreams (mama)
I step up in the club first thing I see is you freakin' it
Your eyes and body language tells me you want me to hit it
Well I say girl
Back that thing up to me
Closer (ohhhh)
A little closer (work it)
Come on and shake it on me now (work it)
Come on and work it on me now (work it)
Girl it's getting heated now (work it)
It's time to put this club on fire now

Make up, and break up, that's all we do
Then we have sex, next thing you know
Everything is cool
Best of Both Worlds, holla at your boy
Like we always do about this time, yeah I know what you doin' ma Tryin' to get
in an argument with me So, I can do my mad thing You want me to do my mad thing
I understand, c'mon
Seems we're always arguing, but Right after the arguing, we have sex And
somehow, it's the best, yes Seems we're always arguing, but Right after the
arguing, we have sex And somehow, it's the best girl
Think about it while the streets you roam It's Dom P and Army in the fridge,
when you get home Sex is always better fresh off a vendetta We break up or
break you off, then we right back together Then this brand new leathers and
Caroline Aurera Marijuana, white wine, somewhere under the weather
Like we sick, but we fine, shit, we couldn't feel better Just some sunshine in
mind lookin' fine as ever Who got a mouth on her, woo, she put some words
together Sometimes, make a nigga wanna leave, but when we make up
Seems we're always arguing, but Right after the arguing, we have sex And
somehow, it's the best, yes Seems we're always arguing, but Right after the
arguing, we have sex And somehow, it's the best, girl
Break up to make up, baby, seems that's all we do darlin' But no one wants to
walk out the door, after all of the holla'n Cursing and fighting and me
sleeping on the couch In the midst of our stormy weather, sex brings the sun
out
After I hit that there Seems we don't have a care Sex makes you say, I'm sorry
And things like, I'm not goin' nowhere
It's somethin' bout the P U S S Y That keeps brother in check, even I Even if
you was a pimp, you couldn't survive Without the H E L P to provide you
Seems we're always arguing, but Right after the arguing, we have sex Somehow,
it's the best, oh, yeah, yeah Seems we're always arguing, but Right after the
arguing, we have sex
Think about it while the streets you roam It's Dom P and Army in the fridge
when you get home Remember that night? You was all like Maybe, we should go our
separate ways for life I hit the lights, fit you tight at the lil' place, right
I hit it, right, you look me right in the eyes like psych
You was goin', through your act 'Til I caught you in the sack And I made you
relax When I hit it hard from the back Yeah, now we back friends And the next
time you need some sex counselin', we
Seems we're always arguing, but Right after the arguing, we have sex And
somehow, it's the best, girl Seems we're always arguing, but Right after the
arguing, we have sex After we get through our duel
Seems we're always arguing, but Right after the arguing, we have sex
From the bathroom to the kitchen, we sex From the kitchen to living room, we
sex From the living room to upstairs, we sex Upstairs to the attic, we sex
Attic to the basement, we sex
From the basement to the car garage, we sex Garage to the back of the Jeep, we
sex Bicycle to the treadmill, we sex Even over by the dirty lawnmower, we sex
The neighbors and the dogs are lookin' crazy, we sex I don't care, because
you're my baby, we sex It's our house, and we can have sex Anytime we want to,
we sex They can kiss my ass, because whoa ho ho Hey, L Don, you feel me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I feel you You and Jay crazy man But it's all good, let's go

Mmm, ohh, ohh ohh
Ooh, ohh no, mmm
You and me, havin sex after an argument, that shit's the best
You and me, havin sex, yeah, after an argument, that shit's the best
(Think about it while the streets you roam) (It's Dom P and Army in the fridge
when you get home)
I storm in, she storm out It's like the "War of the Roses" goin on in my house
It's a little seperation but I know how to fix the situation Mami just sufferin
from love deprevation
So I gotta give her thug reperations Put it in the life until love leg is
shakin Slow and passionate, 'til we forget what happens Then we laughin and we
back friends
You don't have to fuss and fight, why don't you just spend the night Baby,
let's just kiss and hug, you know the words, girl, let's make up So much love
to be made, instead of screamin, "Who's to blame?" Girl, I don't wanna let you
go, I need you so
You and me, havin sex after an argument, that shit's the best You and me, havin
sex, yeah, after an argument, that shit's the best (Think about it while the
streets you roam) (It's Dom P and Army in the fridge when you get home)
Girlfriend didn't believe me when I said I'd be back in a little 'Cause I had
the Chris T on with the crease in the middle Plus a fresh cut and the freezin
icicles On my wrist, on my hand, that's when shit hit the fan
Said, "You never spend timey, what's up with that?" Translated it means Hit it
hard from the back, yeah, she hid my car keys And forced me to fall asleep to
her heartbeat
You don't have to fuss and fight, why don't you just spend the night Baby,
let's just kiss and hug, you know the words, girl, let's make up So much love
to be made, instead of screamin, "Who's to blame?" Girl, I don't wanna let you
go, I need you so
You and me, havin sex after an argument, that shit's the best You and me, havin
sex, yeah, after an argument, that shit's the best (Think about it while the
streets you roam) (It's Dom P and Army in the fridge when you get home)
I don't want, baby I don't want to fight, I just wanna make it right (Ooh yeah)
Put out problems to the side, let's just make sweet love tonight (I don't want)

Baby, I don't want to fight, I just wanna make it right (Ohh love) Put our
problems to the side, let's just make sweet love tonight
Sex so intense, all that's on my mind It ain't feel this good since the very
first time I'm pullin her close, she's pullin away I'm tryin to kiss her mouth
but she keeps turnin her face
Cute sex game like our very first date We ain't know each other well enough, we
had to wait But oh! I know just where your hot spot at You can not deny that,
so do not try that, I do not buy that
You and me, havin sex after an argument, that shit's the best You and me, havin
sex, yeah, after an argument, that shit's the best (Think about it while the
streets you roam) (It's Dom P and Army in the fridge when you get home)

Baby, it's nobody like you, you're a good friend, you know
You've been there for me from the beginning
And this is why I love you, I mean I place no one above you
You know what I'm saying
Anything you want you just come to daddy, listen
When I discovered you, I discovered a piece within A joy like no other, you are
my closest friend If you were a number you'd be a perfect 10 Right out of the
blue skies you were Heaven sent
The way we made love over and over again If I had to describe it, wouldn't know
where to begin I am so proud to be your next of kin You prayed over me when I
had no reason to live
Candy, caramel coated taffies, chocolate covered strawberries Love so sweet,
you're my chocolate factory Gum drops mixed with chocolate, milk bars, there's
so much variety Love so sweet, you're my chocolate factory
Wait a minute, baby Now, if I could write a book on how you make me feel The
title would read, a strong black man and that's for real I've been going round
and round just like a ferris wheel Been in and out of relationships but you're
that deal
There ain't nobody else on God's great earth for me Heaven stirred us up
together and made the perfect chemistry Wouldn't change you for the world as

No one has called but my homies and some bill collectors
Celluler rings, somebody wants to borrow money I two way her, she don't hit me

So I called her mother's house And asked her had she seen my baby Roll my 6
around, lookin for that missin' lady Got back in turned the TV on and caught
the news And I put my hand on my head 'cause I'm so confused
And then I turned the TV down 'Cause I thought I heard a squeaky sound
Somethings goin' on upstairs, yeah 'Cause I know nobody else lives here
Bomp, bomp, bomp As I get closer to the stair ways, all I hear And then I hear
my Baby's voice, in my ear Screamin' out
You're contagious, touch me, baby Give me what you got And a man say Sexy lady,
drive me crazy, drive me wild
All I heard was my baby's voice sayin' You're contagious, touch me, baby Give
me what you got Sexy lady, drive me crazy, drive me wild And I just can't
believe this shit
I ran downstairs lookin' the closet lookin' for that who Said a prayer 'cause
only God knows what I'm gonna do What I saw was enough to drive a preacher wild
I'm in the hall contemplatin' now in my own damn house Who would have thought
she was creepin' with another man The down low happened to me all over again
And then I turned the TV down 'Cause I know I heard a squeaky sound Somethin'
goin' on upstairs, yeah 'Cause I know that no one else lives here
Bomp, bomp, bomp As I get closer to the stair ways, all I hear And then I hear
my baby's voice in my ear Screamin' out
You're contagious, touch me, baby Give me what you got Sexy lady, drive me
crazy, drive me wild
All I can do is hear them say You're contagious, touch me, baby Give me what
you got Sexy lady, drive me crazy, drive me wild I can't believe this shit
What the hell is goin' on Between the sheets in my home? Baby, wait let me
explain Before you start to point your cane

Compound, Rockafella
And Ne-Yo's like young Michael, I'm Quincy
Now hear the flow that broke the Da Vinci code
I'm psycho, everything I write go together so nice
Like a wedding make you wanna throw rice
I'm schizo, clock don't tick so Write sometimes 'til the chicks go noodles I
got screws loose I pull words out the air like Bluetooth
I'm a sandwich short of a picnic, ignorant Thoughts come across you've sworn
that I written this But I didn't so maybe It's good to be crazy, isn't it baby?

I wrote your name on my wall 3000 times last night You were on my mind That's
what you do to me, that's what you do That's what you do to me, that's what you

Then one by one I went down the line just repeating it 'Cause it makes me smile
That's what you do to me, that's what you do That's what you do to me, that's
what you
Some say that it's just strange To act that way but they don't understand No,
they don't get it, you're so magnetic Though it's pathetic to them I simply
turn and say
Just call me crazy Insane, deranged, it don't matter to me Call it what you
want to, I don't care And it doesn't make a difference long as she's there
Just call me crazy Lovin' you is crazy, crazy's what I'll be Ooh crazy, ooh
crazy Ooh, just call me crazy
Lately it seems like every song I write is about you Ooh, I love your style
That's what you do to me, that's what you do That's what you do to me, that's
what you
Baby, and it just don't make no sense How my swagger is crooked if you ain't by
my side That's what you do to me, that's what you do That's what you do to me,
that's what you do
Just call me crazy Insane, deranged, it don't matter to me Call it what you
want to, I don't care And it doesn't make a difference long as she's there
Just call me crazy Lovin' you is crazy, crazy's what I'll be Ooh crazy, ooh
crazy Ooh, just call me crazy
I talk to your picture Ooh, I write your name in the mirror Right after I love
you down I need you so much, can't get enough
Just call me crazy Insane, deranged, it don't matter to me Call it what you
want to, I don't care And it doesn't make a difference long as she's there
Just call me crazy Lovin' you is crazy, crazy's what I'll be Ooh crazy, ooh
crazy Ooh

Private cotillion style One lady's fantasy Trip to Milan tonight Exclusive

Mansions await, your scent That smells just like treasure Dining with me in
suites That overlooks the shore
As we move, then we touch, then we dip Dancin' with a rich man As we move, then
we touch, then we dip Shall we dance, shall we dance, shall we dance? As we
turn, then we stare, then we kiss Dancin' with a rich man As we turn, then we
stare, then we kiss
Kissing the feet of you While listening to bonsais And your angelic grace
Wearing Victoria
Passionate love with you Hearing you, "Oh, oui oui" Some antique jewelry from
Kenshires gallery
As we move, then we touch, then we dip Dancin' with a rich man As we move, then
we touch, then we dip Shall we dance, shall we dance, shall we dance? As we
turn, then we stare, then we kiss Dancin' with a rich man As we turn, then we
stare, then we kiss
And when you'll elevate Like visions of grandeur Mademoiselle and me Behind the
villa doors
Sunsets on yellow sand Thats where we rendezvous Chapels of Valentine Is just
to name a few
As we move, then we touch, then we dip Dancin' with a rich man As we move, then
we touch, then we dip As we turn, then we stare, then we kiss Dancin' with a
rich man As we turn, then we stare, then we kiss
As we move, then we touch, then we dip Dancin' with a rich man As we move, then

Doin' Dishes by R. Kelly Lyrics

Unstoppable, Track Masters, Rockland, come on

Dear God, bring our P.O.W.s home
An' bring our brothers on the lockdown home
Amen
Jeah, it's the nigga from the back blocked
On everybody laptop, sling cracked top Hov, hit this nigga from da shower Hold
a note like da guy who said da British is comin'
My nigga, Kell, oh, yeah, da niggas is comin' Get out ya good dishes or
somethin', like it's Thanksgiving, niggas Hov an' none other than da R An'
without further a due, like Freddy get ready, it's
Whatever happened, Lord? Don't pass me by 'Cause whenever I did wrong, it was
Your name I cried I heard You forgave over an' over again But when I found out
I love You, You became immune to my sins
Laid wide awake in da middle of my sleep I see dead people an' sometimes it's
me, Lord I never wanted to be a thug father I only wanted to be a son of a
father
That's how it sounds inside Worse than da war in Iraq, when it's me against I I
gave up da weed an' somehow I'm still high Three years still seein' them three
guys, Lord
Sometimes I don't know what You want from me But I do know You know what I want
from You Give it to me, come on, take away this Hennessey Take away me runnin'
da streets, stop people from rapin' me Take away all this jealously an'
prejudicy
Lord, You said it was better place I grew up around pimps, hustlers, hoes an'
project gates It's hard to believe in what I can't see I got to get this money
an' feed my family
Whatever it did to you, it guides my life Dear Lord, don't let me die tonight
But if I shall before I wake, I shall, I say It's been a good run from hoodlum
to outin' da states
How could one who made so much foul mistakes Still be allowed to have a smile
on my face? How whatever da case, I'm glad it wasn't murder In a town you never
heard of, from a nickel plated burner
Now my life straight like a perm Tried to take da spot I earn Muthafucka,
better learn
It's Hov, it's the nigga from the back blocked On everybody laptop, sling
cracked top Kell, hit this nigga from da shower Hold a note like da guy who
said da British is comin'
Hov, oh, yeah, da niggas is comin' Get out ya good dishes or somethin', like
it's Thanksgiving, niggas Kell an' none other than da R An' without further a
due, like Freddy get ready, it's
Lord, hear me out, got a few more things to say These demons be chasin' me like
everyday Nah, my life on crutches, never say I'll never walk again But da Devil
is a lie 'cause I believe within'
That You're da reason that I'm still here Even though I don't act like it Even
though I hear my callin' an' fight it Fools do me so wrong, it's hard to stay
righteous Pimpin' was allowed to happen, I'd hide it
Believe me, Lord, I want You Got money an' fame but still it just won't do
Sometimes I don't like who I am When I look in da mirror, my reflection is
Uncle Sam
An' every night I have these weird dreams That a preacher trapped inside of me
wake up an' can't breathe I feel like it's twenty of me Goin' twenty different
directions on a one way street, Lord
I got houses, money an' cars An' met every single superstar I got da whole
music industry sold But it still don't matter, when I'm gone an' my casket
closed
Whatever it did to you, it guides my life Dear Lord, don't let me die tonight
But if I shall before I wake, I'd accept my fate I did what I did, my heart was
in da right place
I guess, so I can live it, put food on my plate You must still love me not to
let it in by three that day Well whatever da case, I'm glad it wasn't murder In
a town you never heard of, from a nickel plated burner
I guess I'm not finished wit my journey Please forgive me for my sins Shit, I'm
still tryna learn me
It's Hov, it's the nigga from the back blocked On everybody laptop, sling
cracked top Kell, hit this nigga from da shower Hold a note like da guy who
said da British is comin'
Hov, oh, yeah, da niggas is comin' Get out ya good dishes or somethin', like
it's Thanksgiving, niggas Kell an' none other than da R An' without further a
due, like Freddy get ready, it's
Many men have come an' gone in these streets Walked alone in these streets,
waitin' to hear from You Oh, Lord, wrap your arms around da hood Lift every
peace from war, bring our soldiers home, let us pray


Baby, now I realize
All of those times I told you I loved you
I just didn't show it I'm sorry
Don't put me out
Don't put me out Don't put me out
I remember when you said to me Don't talk about it be about it I should have
felt you when you said to me That you were all alone
I act like I was doing a favor For you 'cuz you were with me Something let me
thinking that whatever happens This would be my home but I was wrong How could
I have been so low? I wrote a song all about it Wanna hear it, here we go, from
now on
I won't talk about lovin' you 'Cuz I'm gonna be about lovin' you I won't talk
about comin' home 'Cuz I'm gonna be about comin' home I won't talk about both
of us 'Cuz I'm gonna be about both of us I won't talk about makin' sweet love
'Cuz I'm gonna be about makin' sweet love
Now I remember when we used the crib in Studio 12A Clothes and pallets on the
floor makin' sweet love night till day Used to say I wanna have a baby boy and
call him, "Man" But now it's all gone up in smoke and baby, I don't understand
All I know that is I was wrong How could I have stooped so low? I wrote a song
about it All about it, wanna hear it Here we go, from now on
I won't talk about lovin' you 'Cuz I'm gonna be about lovin' you I won't talk
about comin' home 'Cuz I'm gonna be about comin' home I won't talk about both
of us 'Cuz I'm gonna be about both of us I won't talk about makin' sweet love
'Cuz I'm gonna be about makin' sweet love
Now all the money in the world could not add up to what you did 'Cuz when I was
down and out you took the burden off of me I never thought that when I took her
out somehow it'd cause me pain I was rooming at the Drake, how the hell you
found my name?
Damn, I was wrong How could I have stooped so low? I wrote a song All about it,
wanna hear it Here we go, from now on
I won't talk about lovin' you 'Cuz I'm gonna be about lovin' you I won't talk
about comin' home 'Cuz I'm gonna be about comin' home I won't talk about both
of us 'Cuz I'm gonna be about both of us I won't talk about makin' sweet love
'Cuz I'm gonna be about makin' sweet love I won't talk about lovin' you 'Cuz
I'm gonna be about lovin' you
Girl, open up the door and let me in this house Please baby, I'm tired of
banging on this door The neighbors say I'm loud, honey, I beg of you
Don't put me out Don't put me out Don't put me out ...

Down low double life
1, 2 equals us, she, she and me, I fell in loves
How could something so right go so wrong?
Just coming in on flight 412 but she was listening on the phone
I thought I had it all together but I was wrong obviously 'Coz what was once
done in the dark came to light eventually
Living down low, down low Living that double life Living down low, down low
Living that double life, it ain't right
I don't believe the shit I did, the night we were at your mom's I got a page
from out of town, lied and said, "It was my job" Grabbed my hat, coat, gloves
and scarf, I told you that I would return But by the look upon your face you
had already discerned So you pulled me to the side and you begged for me to
stay But I was caught up in a life that forced me to walk away
Living down low, down low Living that double life Living down low, down low
Living that double life, it ain't right
Okay you, you're saying you came in and And these two women they, they poured
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, it wasn't nothing like that All I know is uh, I was
asleep, they came in Woke me up pourin' hot grits and all kinds of shit on me
man Okay, beatin' me and shit, hittin' me with all sorts of type shit Damn
With a cigar in my mouth over Vegas city lights On a path way up the hill to be
with my other wife A rich nigga living strife going on like nothing's wrong But
that damn caller ID is the reason for this song So one called up the other
while I was out playing some golf Talking about my doggish ways and how I need
to be dropped off
Living down low, down low Living that double life Living down low, down low
Living that double life, it ain't right
Now go ahead, shoot me now because I'm guilty as sin Playin' Russian roulette
with hearts not to mention the kids Now every day I live, I regret all that I
did Out smoking with friends as I reminisced
Living down low, down low Living that double life Living down low, down low
Living that double life, it ain't right
I can't take it no more, I've got to confess See now, I don't know why I
thought that I could keep creeping 'Coz you see what goes around comes back on
around And back on around and back on around again, yes it does, oh
In a state of shock that's what it left me Take it from a man who knows that
three ain't company No, no, no that's what I kept telling myself Now I done
lost the houses, the kids and the dogs Now I'm sleeping in my momma's house and
even she says "Your sorry ass don't deserve no help" Must be because of what my
old man did to her

There will be more tears As she's beginning to drive away It's all clear now
There's no real reason to have the pain
Now I know love has kept me here and my pride has kept me here And hope keeps
singing it's alright, I'll be fine
But she'll be going elsewhere And she'll be lying else where And she'll be
wanted elsewhere And I'll be somewhere thinking about her
And she'll be living elsewhere And she'll be laughing elsewhere And she'll be
happy elsewhere And I'll be just fine without her someday That's what I keep
telling myself
Was it the right thing? Was this our biggest mistake? Still call sometimes but
she's got nothing to say And still she stays away
It's got me questioning If I ever meant the same to her How could she? Why
would she do these things? Put me through this pain now
If love is what we have then how could it have been so bad That she don't think
it's worth a fight, she won't try
But she'll be trying elsewhere And she'll be loving elsewhere And she'll keep
secrets elsewhere And I'll be somewhere thinking about her
And she'll be willing elsewhere And she will be giving elsewhere And she'll
have feelings elsewhere But hope keeps saying Kells, you can make it
But in the meantime I can't sleep, I can't think There's so many things in my
head Things she said, things that she meant Things that I started feeling the
day that she left
Things that I slept on, things that I should have accepted Things I expected
and the things I neglected I better get up off my Catch the first flight out
and get her back or else
She'll be living elsewhere And she'll be crying elsewhere And shell be feeling
elsewhere And I'll be somewhere thinking about her
She'll be smiling elsewhere And she'll be laughing elsewhere Giving all of my
sweet love away elsewhere That's the reason why I gotta catch that flight I'm
out of time

Mansions, hills and acres Women, drinks and caterers I will toast until the
break of dawn Swimming pools and strippers Conversation six figures Never
crossed my mind to call home There's a note on the bathroom mirror Tellin' me
that you've had enough It took, you leavin' me For my, blind eyes to see That
you mean?
(Far more) than this planet to me (Far more) than the air I breathe (Far more)
from here to overseas (Far more) girl you're all I need (Far more) than the
mountains and trees (Far more) you mean more than the birds and bees (Far more)
honey take it from me (Far more) you are all I need
Hangin' out with friends Never calling to check in Neglecting you in every way
Taking the home front for granted What was straight is now slanted And I don't
know what to do about this love There's a note on the bathroom mirror (ohh)
Tellin' me that you've had enough It took, you leavin' me For my, blind eyes to
see That you mean?
(Far more) more than this planet to me (Far more) more than the air I breathe
(Far more) from here to overseas (Far more) girl you're all I need (Far more)
than the mountains and trees (Far more) than the birds and bees (Far more)
honey take it from me (Far more) you're all I need
Shoo-op, shoo-op Skiddlily-be-bop, hip-hop (ohh) Shoo-op, shoo-op Skiddlily-be-
bop, hip-hop (ohh) Shoo-op, shoo-op Skiddlily-be-bop, hip-hop Far more, far
more Shoo-op, shoo-op Skiddlily-be-bop, hip-hop Shoo-op, shoo-op Skiddlily-be-
bop, hip-hop (hip-hop) Shoo-op, shoo-op Skiddlily-be-bop, hip-hop (skiddily-be-

than the mountains and trees (Far more) the birds and the bees (Far more) honey
take it from me (Far more) you are all I need (Far more) yeah (Far more) ever
since you've been gone (Far more) I've realized girl (Far more) just what it is
I had at home (Far more) oh baby you mean far more (Far more) than this planet
to me (Far more) than this air I breathe (Far more) nothing can compare to your
love for me (Far more) to your love for me (Far more) to your love for me (Far
more) to your love for me (Far more) to your love for me?

thing my eyes can see?(and I tell you there aint no man) There aint no man
gonna stop the vision?(I'm a part of the ghetto) The ghetto is a part of me
Children cry no more?(children cry no more) Because heaven is upon you Please
put down your guns And we shall overcome Thought your load may be heavy Know
that the weight makes you strong Take my life for example While I sing my song
Mr. Kelly help me sing this song?
The ghetto is a part of my religion?(the only thing my eyes can see) The only
thing my eyes can see?(and I tell you there aint no man) There aint no man
gonna stop the vision?(I'm a part of the ghetto) The ghetto is a part of me
The ghetto is a part of my religion?(the only thing my eyes can see) The only
thing my eyes can see?(and I tell you there aint no man) There aint no man

all i see is clear
and nothing else in this world
mattered to me just as long as i had you near i step right off the highest
mountain thinking i can walk the sky tell me and i would believe but this would
be the last time you make me cry cause i can see you're nothing but a smoke
screen

nothing but a ghost to me a ghost and you don't exist no more see you used to
be my dream now all you do is haunt me go, go go
i used to think heaven  when i looked at you  because you were an angel to me
but now all this hell that you took me through baby,you lost your wings i used
to feel like i was on top of the world with you i would go anywhere but then i
woke up at the bottom of the surf and saw you both lying ahead

heart in two i don't wanna have nothing to do with you and even though i still

And we want yall to know that we recognize that
There are so many answers to the question what yall do for us
And so many reasons for the word why we love on yall For instance how you just
take us and lift us up Give us chance after chance and we still find a way to
Fuck things up And sometimes yall go and blame yourself for the things we do
Cause you love us so much our lies become the truth Yall try so, so hard to
make things work Finding a way to smile just to keep from showing your hurting
Its your mind versus your heart versus your soul versus your body Versus our
bullshit and our ego and our pride Thats why I love the word woman (oh I love,
I love) Yall are so tough yall put up with so much Thats why I love the word
woman (oh I love, I love) And yall so full of trust and besides yall know us
Thats why I love the word woman Time and time again yall let us back in And I
love yall so much I gotta spell it out W-O-M-A-N thats what its all about, yeah

Sometimes I think that were the reason why yall be stressing out and smoking
Cigarettes, mmm yes I do And sometimes I think were the reasons yall be
snapping off on your kids and Having fits, somebody feel me Ladies when its
that time of the month and yall really dont feel like being Bothered And
sometimes we take yall hearts for granted I know yall gotta ask yall Selves
sometimes why do I even put up with it
Its your mind versus your heart versus your soul versus your body Versus our
bullshit and our ego and our pride Thats why I love the word woman (oh I love,
I love) Yall are so tough yall put up with so much Thats why I love the word
woman (oh I love, I love) And yall so full of trust and besides yall know us
Thats why I love the word woman Time and time again yall let us back in And I
love yall so much I gotta spell it out W-O-M-A-N thats what its all about, yeah

Fellas just swallow your pride for a minute and grab your lady by the hand and
Sing Baby Im sorry for the drama that I caused you Yall are the backbone of
every family this much is true I recognize being a woman the things yall go
through And I appreciate every single one of you Baby I promise from this day I
will show respect I promise to love yall yeah With all of my might yeah Ill
even burn a candlelight Because we are here cause yall paid a price And thats
why I love
Its your mind versus your heart versus your soul versus your body Versus our
bullshit and our ego and our pride Thats why I love the word woman (oh I love,
I love) Yall are so tough yall put up with so much Thats why I love the word
woman (oh I love, I love) And yall so full of trust and besides yall know us
Thats why I love the word woman Time and time again yall let us back in And I
love yall so much I gotta spell it out W-O-M-A-N thats what its all about, yeah

Dear Mama, you wouldn't believe what I'm goin' through
But still I got my head up just like I promised you
Every since you left your baby, boy's been dealin' with
Problem after problem, tell me what am I supposed to do
See, I get lost sometimes, don't understand this place Look in the mirror
sometimes and see a troubled face And then my tears roll down and hit the sink
Then I hold my head up high I hope the man upstairs can hear my cry
All these questions deep inside my mind Like if Jesus loved me why He leave my
side, mama I'm still tryin' to get the answer why You were young, 45, and you
had to die
I'm always tryin' to help people out And it's them same people tryin' to take
food out my mouth
(Fo' real though) It seems like the more money I make (Fo' real though) The
more drama y'all try to create (Fo' real though) And through I try to move into
the positive (Fo' real though) The more y'all don't wanna let me live
When will you realize that I don't owe you nothin' Need to get up off your butt
and go get your own somethin' I'm pullin' on my hair to keep from snappin' off
Fools ride up in my camp and be actin' off
Somebody out there please pray what I'm talkin' 'bout Still young tryin' to
figure it out I
Heaven, I need a hug Is there anybody out there willin' to embrace a thug
Feelin' like a change of heart And all I really need is a sign of a word from
God
So shower down on me Wet me with your love I need you to take me And lift me
up, oh yeah
I gave 13 years of my life to this industry Hit song or not, I've given all of
me You smile in my face and tell me that you love But then before you know the
truth, you're so quick to judge me
That's alright, go ahead, keep talkin' 'Cause I'm a hold my head up high and
keep walkin' And reach for the sky, focus on the plan Rescue the kid with his
paper and pen
And this is for the homies that we lost Yo', we cannot forget y'all, so the
hats come off We pour a little liquor out for the memory I know y'all up there
sittin' on chrome in them pearly streets
The street survivors before careful, stay alive I'm prayin' for your families,
I hope you pray for mine
(Fo' real though) Used to be a time you wished me well (Fo' real though) It
hurts to know you wanna see me fail (Fo' real though) And don't forget I kept
you out of jail (Fo' real though) Where's my arms when you needed to be held
They turn they backs on you, who was there believin' Who said your troubles
were only for a season In church together tryin' to pick up all the pieces And
now you betray me I bind you in the name of Jesus
Somebody please pray what I'm talkin' 'bout Still young tryin' to figure it all
out
Heaven, I need a hug Is there anybody out there willin' to embrace a thug Girl
I can change a heart And all I really need is a sign of a word from God
(Please shower down) So shower down on me Wet me with your love (Yeah) I need
you to take me and lift me up Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Man, I tell you it's enough to make you wanna give it up Thank God for my fans
'cause through it all they show me love
To my sister and to brothers Tell me why can't we just try to get along with
one another And stop hurtin' one another, fightin' one another Man, I pray to
God He get my family back together
Let me see what wanna see, just to blind me All of these luxuries, wine and
dining And then you push me out in front to get behind me Then you sat me up by
blessin' me to bind me
I'm a grown man with kids now, stakes are high Gotta go to church now to avoid

 I got a special hideaway   Where you and me can be alone
Verse 1:  Oooo, baby this love making is so good that I can't picture myself

The way to walk and dress, your smile, your grace and sex  Tonight nothing's
gonna come between us but sex
Chorus:   You bring me joy   Night and day  Girl you and me should getaway  I
got a special hideaway  Where you and me can be alone  Imagine you and me naked

Like a river  I'm gonna be flowing all over you girl
And like a horsey  I'm gonna saddle up a ride you girl    Like a something
Something again

You made the sun You made the moon Gave seasons change
You made the clouds You put the rainbow After the rain
Created time Now which one's mine Gave pictures frames
Created man Gave him woman Why did You do that for me?
These are the questions asked Before I lay me down and go to sleep Sometimes I
wonder why you decided To keep Your hands on me
Of all the miracles, signs and wonders There's still one mystery How did You
manage to love me?
You breathe the life Right into me Then made my heart beat
Created the mountains All of the deep seas Flowers and the trees
You made tomorrow Come again You calm the strong winds
After all I've done You gave me a son Tell me why would You do that for me?
These are the questions asked Before I lay me down and go to sleep Sometimes I
wonder why You decided To keep Your hands on me
Of all the miracles, signs and wonders There's still one mystery How did You
manage to love me? How did You manage to love me?
Said, "I've got to know how" After all the wrong I've done, oh Lord, how? After
I've been so bad, oh Lord, how? Even when I didn't believe in me, you believed
in me Lord, how?
Jesus, You sacrificed Your great life for me Ooh Lord, tell me Ooh, You, oh
why?


How do I tell her that I'm going away?
When I know that she'll be begging me to stay
And how do I tell her that the time has come to part?
When she's, she's gonna take it so hard
I don't wanna break her heart I don't wanna see her cry, no 'Cause I promised
her forever That I'd be by her side so
So how do I tell her, how do I tell her Tell her goodbye? Oh yeah
How do I tell her that my path has gone and changed? When I know that her heart
won't be able to stand the pain, oh no And how do I tell her that I'm moving on
with my life When she's just gonna break down and die, oh
I don't wanna break her heart, no I don't wanna see her cry, no When I promised
the girl forever I'd be by her side so
So how do I tell her Tell her, tell her goodbye? Oh yeah, whoa
Listen, she's been forever faithful, honest and true, yes, she has My God, this
has gotta be the worst thing that I ever had to do How, how, how, how, how,
how?
How do I tell her, oh, oh, that the time has come to part? When I know that
she's gonna take it so very hard, yes, she is
Said, I don't wanna break her heart I don't wanna see the little girl cry When
I promised her forever, oh, oh That I'd be by her side
How do I tell her Tell her, tell her goodbye, bye, bye, bye? Oh baby, bye and

I Believe lyrics By R. KELLY
BARACK OBAMA:
In small towns and big cities
We came together
As democrats, republicans, and independents To stand up and say that we are ONE
NATION, we are ONE PEOPLE And our time for changed has COME..
R. KELLY: When the mountain seems too high And you dont have the courage nor
the strength to climb And the road youre on wont end But still you run though
you cannot see the finish line
And dark clouds are over you Your skies no longer blue But you marched on
straight ahead Somehow you made it through
Got to the mountain peek They left a path of me Your victory made history and
now
CHORUS: I believe, I believe, I believe Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe Oh,
I believe, I believe, I believe Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe Oh I
When it felt like you were weak And couldnt fight no more On the ropes and it
seemed like You was gonna run out of breathe
When the world was on your shoulder And the walls were in your way You leaped
and made it over Through it all you kept the faith [ From: http://

With hope you set us free You showed us how to dream And now we can lift our
voices And forever sing
Nows the time to look ahead And thank our heros of the past And celebrate
this history Lets raise the flag cause
CHORUS: I believe, I believe, I believe Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe Oh,
I believe, I believe, I believe Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe Oh I
BRIDGE: And when they tried to keep you down You kept up your head Never losing
sight You believed in what was right
You endured to the end Walked through the strongest wind The storms over And a
new day begins
And when our hope was dying You brought us healing And now I got something To
tell my children
CHORUS: I believe, I believe, I believe Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe Oh,
I believe, I believe, I believe Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe Oh I

I used to think that I could not go on
And life was nothing but an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms
If I can see it, then I can do it If I just believe it, there's nothing to it
I believe I can fly I believe I can touch the sky I think about it every night
and day Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar I see me running through that open door I believe I can
fly, I believe I can fly I believe I can fly
See I was on the verge of breaking down Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve But first I know it starts inside of
me
If I can see it, then I can be it If I just believe it, there's nothing to it
I believe I can fly I believe I can touch the sky I think about it every night
and day Spread wings and fly away
I believe I can soar I see me running through that open door I believe I can
fly, I believe I can fly I believe I can fly
Hey, 'cause I believe in you Oh, if I can see it, then I can do it If I just
believe it, there's nothing to it
I believe I can fly I believe I can touch the sky I think about it every night
and day Spread wings and fly away
I believe I can soar I see me running through that open door I believe I can
fly, I believe I can fly I believe I can fly
If I just spread my wings (I can fly) I can fly (I can fly)
I can fly (I can fly) I can fly (I can fly)
If I just spread my wings (I can fly) I can fly (I can fly, I can fly) Ooh, I
can fly Hmm, fly, fly, fly


Hey, hey, hey

I decided to stay home tonight
I decided I'm a treat you right
I decided to be there for you
Decided to be on my P's and Q's
I decided to give up my friends Decided I'm a take you out weekends Decided to
give you a reason to trust These are decisions that I made for love
Enough is enough, no more runnin' around Searchin' for what's right here at
home Because my luck is 'bout to turn around And I just can't keep doing you
wrong Girl, I take it for granted that you will be here always Tired of this
ego trip 'Cause soon you'll be searchin' for another man And I just can't have
that happen to me
I decided to stay home tonight I decided I'm a treat you right I decided to be
there for you Decided to be on my P's and Q's I decided to give up my friends
Decided I'm a take you out weekends Decided to give you a reason to trust These
are decisions that I made for love
Now I've had about all that I can stand no more Turnin' in my player's card
See, I'm retiring from the secret life I chose 'Cause I just can't keep
breakin' your heart It was silly of me to be the way that I was First was blind
but now I see Baby, soon you'll be sayin' you're fallin' out of love And I just
can't let it happen, whoa I
I decided to stay home tonight I decided I'm a treat you right I decided to be
there for you Decided to be on my P's and Q's I decided to give up my friends
Decided I'm a take you out weekends Decided to give you a reason to trust These
are decisions that I made for love
When the mornin' comes you'll see The sun will shine on you and me Was on my
way to losing you until I found reality So cast away, your doubts and fears
'Cause from now on I'll be right here For always, forever more I decided
I decided to stay home tonight I decided I'm a treat you right I decided to be
there for you Decided to be on my P's and Q's I decided to give up my friends
Decided I'm a take you out weekends Decided to give you a reason to trust These
are decisions that I made for love
I decided to stay home tonight I decided I'm a treat you right I decided to be
there for you Decided to be on my P's and Q's I decided to give up my friends
Decided I'm a take you out weekends Decided to give you a reason to trust These
are decisions that I made for love

Yeah, like I was saying I ain't ya know what
I'm not tryin' to say things to hurt you, you know what I'm saying
I don't wanna hurt you baby, just sometimes you do things
That push me to say things I don't wanna say
You know what I'm saying?
You know I love you, you know I care about you This time, you just brought it
on yourself Yo, check it out
Now I should a been more man about the way things went down Especially since we
been dealin' for like seven years now I've been slowly, slowly bringing you
down No conversation, no good sex in a while
But still you search and find a way to love me somehow Even though I ride you
still trust me somehow Got my faces, some ice and a tie Slowly, slowly, slowly,
slowly goin' down
(I don't mean it) When I holler at you (I don't mean it) When I say that we're
through (I don't mean it) What I'm takin' you through (I don't mean it) Baby
(I don't mean it) Said I'm sorry (I don't mean it) Can you find a way to
forgive me (I don't mean it) Said I went to church this morning (I don't mean
it) I don't mean it
Running around here talking about how I'm a big player now Hidden in corners
blinging out our share Kelly makin' hits now Thinking about this industry and
how I put it out You were there for me when I used dish rags for ties
There's times that I didn't hear you I was talkin' too loud When I didn't come
home I was hanging with the crowd Whenever we fight I try to win every round
Can you find a way to forgive me now?
(I don't mean it) 'Cuz I don't mean it (I don't mean it) When I holler at you
(I don't mean it) Whenever I say we're through (I don't mean it) Whoa
(I don't mean it) Can you find a way to forgive me? (I don't mean it) Ooh baby,
I (I don't mean it) I went to church this mornin' (I don't mean it) Ooh I don't
mean it
Father, can you help me? What do you need from Me? I broke up with my girl and
I'm feelin' kinda lonely I been watching you from Heaven, Kelly you been so
demanding You need to read My word, son and get some understanding
But I been busy with my music Stop making excuses recognize the love she gives
And try not to abuse it Is it too late to get her back? Not as long as I'm a
fact Well Father, show me a sign That will make her mine
(I don't mean it) I don't mean it (I don't mean it) Whenever I say we're
through (I don't mean it) Or whenever I holler at you (I don't mean it) Ooh ooh
ooh ooh ooh
(I don't mean it) Ooh baby, ooh baby (I don't mean it) See what was straight is
now stone (I don't mean it) Because I took you for granted, oh (I don't mean
it) Whoa
(I don't mean it) I don't mean it (I don't mean it) Whoa you should know I
don't mean it (I don't mean it) I put it on my life (I don't mean it) Believe
me I pay the price
(I don't mean it) When I was down and out (I don't mean it) You reached out
your hand (I don't mean it) I've learned it takes a good woman (I don't mean
it) To raise a man
(I don't mean it) Oh, I love you baby (I don't mean it) Oh oh oh I love you
baby (I don't mean it) Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh (I don't mean it)


Heard 'em say man wasn't made to fly
And when he wanted to go to the moon,
They said he wouldn't make it past the sky
And with all odds against him
They said he'd never reach his goal Said he didnt have the strength To travel
that long road
But i had a dream I had a dream I had a dream That i made history I had a dream
I had a dream I had a dream Now the dream is real to me
Heard 'em say that the mountain couldn't be climbed And when ever thers an
under dog they count him out everytime Some body say that the storm will
never...... And in the crunch of the game They said that theres no way that
team could win
 But i
had a dream I had a dream I had a dream That i made history I had a dream I had
a dream I had a dream Now the dream is real to me
When the battle seems lost And all your strength is gone Just know that the
winds are faithful In carrying you home Just believe in the power The power of
Love
I had a dream I had a dream I had a dream That i made history I had a dream I
had a dream I had a dream Now the dream is real to me x2

Chorus

Verse Three
You need a man who'll be  patient or not cool the public arrest you or lovely
respect you. But who you are no what you was or will be, and the harder ya ever

I'm feelin' kinda lonely I been watching you from Heaven, Kelly you been so
demanding You need to read My word, son and get some understanding
But I been busy with my music Stop making excuses recognize the love she gives
And try not to abuse it Is it too late to get her back? Not as long as I'm a
fact Well Father, show me a sign That will make her mine
(I don't mean it) I don't mean it (I don't mean it) Whenever I say we're
through (I don't mean it) Or whenever I holler at you (I don't mean it) Ooh ooh

don't mean it (I don't mean it) I put it on my life (I don't mean it) Believe
me I pay the price
(I don't mean it) When I was down and out (I don't mean it) You reached out
your hand (I don't mean it) I've learned it takes a good woman (I don't mean
it) To raise a man
(I don't mean it) Oh, I love you baby (I don't mean it) Oh oh oh I love you

that we once shared There was love on, up until You went and changed on me And
everybody knew that you were playing me Oh yeah, love was so good that I was
blind I feel for you Wanna be there for you [ From: http://www.metrolyrics.com/
 But baby boy I gotta keep it real with you And
I can not let you just run over me, so I quit you, no more, baby, no more I
quit you, you're driving me crazy I quit you, madly you go boy so bye, bye I
quit you, cause you hurt me But no more boy, so why I'm about to change the
lock Girl I So you can't get to my heart And I'll throw away the key So you
can't get in to me Got my mind on another place I can find someone who
understands To get myself another man, cause you ain't right boy I quit you, no
more, baby, no more I quit you, you're driving me crazy I quit you, yes I do
You hurt me for the last time I quit you, oh boy, playing these games with my
mind I quit you. oh yeah I quit you, I quit you yes I do I quit you I quit you
Yeah I quit you Means no more kisses, no more huggin', no more lovin'

Yeah I know, y'know, what a calling is
I mean we all have a calling in our life, I believe
You know I'm from the dirt, man
I come up in these streets, went without eatin'
You know what I'm sayin'?
Saw my mom go without eatin' I got tired of that I had to go out there In them
streets and hustle, you know? I mean you know what I'm sayin'?
I mean it's easy for y'all to say, y'know Surrender your life, you know what
I'm sayin'? Give your life to God and all that Y'know, that's good and I
believe in God But when you got bills at your front door all the time You know
what I'm sayin'?
Kids screamin' "Daddy, Momma, where the food at?" Man it makes it kinda hard to
believe in Y'know, and have faith in something that you can't see Even though
you wanna believe Y'all just gonna have to just pray for me You know what I'm
sayin'? 'Cause uh
Constantly my mind and my heart is racing All by myself trying to solve all of
these problems I'm facing Looking to man, trying to find hope But man will
never know the depth of my struggles
I was depending on myself to give myself a hand But when depending on myself
fell and time again And that's why I'm standing here alone with no one else
Lord I realized that I can't fight these battles by myself
I surrender, I surrender, I surrender to You, Lord I surrender, I surrender, I
surrender to You, Lord I surrender, I surrender, I surrender to You, Lord
Coming out with both hands up, I surrender
Listen, I tried everything I could to make it work But everything I seemed to
try just made it worse And every road that I'd go down there were no signs
Destination lonely with no peace of mind
I was depending on myself to give myself a hand But when depending on myself
fell and time again And that's why I'm standing here alone with no one else
Lord I realized that I can't fight these battles by myself, I surrender
I surrender, I surrender, I surrender to you, Lord I surrender, I surrender, I
surrender to you, Lord I surrender, I surrender, I surrender to you, Lord
Coming out with both hands up, I surrender
Won't you guard the place around it? There's nowhere for me to go Joy I have
tried to find, see I've searched high and I've searched low Said you walked
throughout the building So come and rescue me from this hell 'cause I can't do
it by myself
I surrender, I surrender, I surrender to you, Lord I surrender, I surrender, I
surrender to you, Lord I surrender, I surrender, I surrender to you, Lord I
surrender, I surrender, I surrender to you, Lord
I surrender, I surrender, I surrender to you, Lord I surrender, I surrender, I
surrender to you, Lord I surrender, I surrender, I surrender to you, Lord I
surrender, I surrender


I wish, I wish, I wish
To every city
I wish, I wish, I wish
Every hood
I wish, I wish, I wish And every block I wish, I wish, I wish Ghetto America
Rollin' through the hood, just stopped by to say, what's up? And let you know
your baby boy ain't doin' so tough Even though you passed, goin' on four long
years Still wakin' up late at night cryin' tears
Just thinkin' about those days you used to talk to me Smilin' while I'm sippin'
on this Hennessey And remember, we'd brag on how rich we would be To get out
this hood was like a fantasy
And now you hear my songs the radio is playin' Oh, I can't believe my ears And
what everybody is sayin' Boy, I tell you folks don't know the half
I would give it all up just to take one ride With you How I used to kick it on
the front porch With you And how I used to lay back and smoke weed With you And
all the little basement party joints we'd do Now, I'm just missing you
How I wish, I wish that I could hold you now I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you Be with you somehow
I know, I know you're in a better place Even though I can't see your face I
know you're smilin' down on me Sayin' everything's okay
And if I make it out, this thug life See you again someday I wish, I wish, I
wish I wish, I wish, I wish
Ever since this money come, it's been nothing but stress Sometimes I wish that
I could just trade in my success Y'all look at me and say, boy, you've been
blessed But y'all don't see the inside of my unhappiness
Man, I swear this shit gets heavy like a ton That's why you hear me shootin'
this real shit off like a gun I wonder how my friends would treat me now If I
was iced up with a Bentley and a house
That's why fake-ass niggas get fake-ass digits And fake-ass players get a real
player hatin 'em 'Honey Love' goes platinum and y'all ass come round But y'all
don't wanna raise the roof until my shit is goin' down
And now you hear my songs the radio is playin' Oh, I can't believe my ears And
what everybody is sayin' Boy, I tell you folks don't know the half
I would give it all up just to take one ride With you And how I used to hoop
off in them to tournaments With you And how I used to club hop on weekends With
you Your family called the morning of the tragic end Damn, my condolences
I wish that I could hold you now I wish that I could touch you now I wish that
I could talk to you Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place Even though I can't see your face I know you're
smilin' down on me Sayin' everything's okay
And if I make it out this thug life See you again someday I wish, I wish, I
wish I wish, I wish, I wish
Voices in my head been tellin' me to come to church Say, the Lord is the only
way for you to stop the hurt Dreamin' of windows, black-tinted like a hearse
But wakin' up to life sometimes seems worse
And all I ever wanted is to be a better man And I try to keep it real with my
homies, man Want me to save the world, I don't understand How did I become the
leader of a billion fans
And now you hear my songs the radio is playin' Oh, I can't believe my ears And
what everybody's sayin' Boy, I tell you folks don't know the half
I would give it all up just to take one ride With you How I used to street
perform on Friday With you And how I'd go to church on Easter Sunday With you
Instead of y'all throwin' them stones at me Somebody pray for me
Oh, I wish that I could hold you now I wish that I could touch you now I wish
that I could talk to you Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place Even though I can't see your face I know you're
smilin' down on me Sayin' everything's okay
Oh, I wish that I could hold you now I wish that I could touch you now I wish
that I could talk to you Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place Even though I can't see your face I know you're
smilin' down on me Sayin' everything's okay
Oh, I wish that I could hold you now I wish that I could touch you now I wish
that I could talk to you Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place Even though I can't see your face I know you're
smilin' down on me Sayin' everything's okay
Oh, I wish that I could hold you now I wish that I could touch you now I wish
that I could talk to you Be with you somehow


Yo, what up my nigga
You know I was in the hood
I just thought I'd stop by and
Holler at you for a minute
Pour out a little liquor or somethin'
Nigga we done been through a lot of shit together From runnin' these streets to
bein' down for whatever And now that you're gone I got a whole lot of shit to
tell you Things I should've said way back when we was younger
Remember when we used to roll hand in hand And now I'm trippin' on how I really
miss you man And remember when you and me would say We'd get up out this hood
and everything would be okay
It's all good now my nigga we out the hood now And we had the same ideas but
not the same careers We shared the same old laugh and now the same tears
You were my homie, my sconey, my roni My nigga and never placed no bitch before
me Man, I sear to God I love you for that shit Why'd you have to get hit, where
was I, what time was it
You were supposed to get older with me On stage, hands on shoulders with me
Coppin' them Range Rovers with me Sittin' on thangs and smokin' trees
And if it wasn't for the will that God had made I'd turn back the hands of time
and take your place Sittin' here sippin' on this Hennessey Just thinkin' about
what you meant to me my nigga
Even when you're gone you will always be my nigga When you went home I'm still
missin' you, my nigga I'm feelin' like the timing was wrong, my nigga I know
you're smilin' down sayin' carry on, my nigga
Some times my nights can get long, my nigga Some times I feel that God did me
wrong, my nigga So I had to write a song, my nigga Just to let you know that
you're still my nigga
I wish, I wish, I wish I wish, I wish, I wish
Little son is lookin' at me like where is my daddy? And your 13 year old
daughter is mad 'cause she understands Promised your mama I'd take care of the
family But shes so hurt, she turns away my helpin' hands
Damn, I wish your ass was here my nigga To grow that gray beard and smoke that
cigar my nigga And we would talk about you gettin' up out this game And you
would tell me how it keeps callin' your name
We used to ride ride ride Never afraid to die die die But some times we cry,
cry, cry Askin' the lord why why why They're tearin' down these projects
We were homies for like 20 thug years Sat in church and cried the same thug
tears And you remember when vibe world premier How we used to share the same
old gear
And remember when you and me would say We'd get up out this hood and everything
would be okay
It's all good now my nigga we out the hood now It's so easy for folks to say,
rob just live on When I'm dyin' every second that you're gone Never the less I
try my best to be strong Hopin' you said your prayers before you went on home
When we stood on these blocks and just shot the breeze We'd slap box dead in
the middle of streets And if a fight broke out, you would take up for me You're
all I have left of these ghetto memories
I wish, I wish, I wish I wish, I wish, I wish
Uh, uh, yo dog, I cant explain how I miss you We stayed together, coppin' cane,
poppin' pistols I miss you most puttin' the doo rag over your bean head Even
out the hood on the scene you brag
Comin' up off the fiends for bags Runnin' up out the cleaners, drag You was the
closest nigga I had Look how we stayed aces hustled made big faces
I wish we could trade places Fuck givin' you ice, I'd rather give you life And
the things that I had, I'd give you twice
So what the deal, my nigga, I know you holdin' it down If you could see me you
would say I'm talkin' soft right now But it's hard for me to see when I'mma see
you again And I know its fucked up, I gotta talk through this pen
But you'd died for the love of the dough The love of the block, 16 you was
runnin' the spot Boy, your mama used to hate how we stood on the curb Hangin'
with wild thug niggas, smokin' the herb
I'm gonna keep pourin' this liquor and that's my word This here is for niggas
that be flippin' them birds, word up
Even though you know you will always be my nigga Even though you're gone you
will also be my nigga I'm feelin' like the time when I'm high, my nigga When
you're gone, when you're gone my nigga
Some times my nights can get long, my nigga Some times I feel that God did me
wrong, my nigga So I had to write a song, my nigga Just to let you know that
you're still my nigga

How did I ever let you slip away?
Never knowing, I'd be singing this song some day
And now I'm sinking, sinking to rise no more
Ever since you closed the door
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time Then my darlin', you'd still be
mine If I could turn, turn back the hands of time Then darlin' you, you'd still
be mine
Funny, funny how time goes by And blessings are missed in the wink of an eye Oh
why, oh why should one have to go on suffering? When every day I pray, please
come back to me
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time Then my darlin' you, you'd be mine
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time Then my darlin', you still be mine

And you had enough love for the both of us But I, I, I did you wrong I admit I
did But now, I'm facing the rest of my life alone, whoa
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time Then my darlin' you, you'd be
mine, whao If I could turn, turn back the hands of time Then my darlin', you
still be mine
Oh, I'd never hurt you (If I could turn back) Never do you wrong (If I could
turn back) And never leave your side (If I could turn back the hands) Turn back
the hands
There'd be nothing I wouldn't do for you (If I could turn back) Forever honest
and true to you (If I could turn back) If you accept me back in your heart, I
love you (If I could turn back the hands)
(If I could turn back) That would be my will (If I could turn back) Darlin' I'm
begging you to take me by the hands (If I could turn back the hands)
I'm going down, yes I am (If I could turn back) Down on my bended knee, yeah
(If I could turn back) And I'm gonna be right there, until you return to me (If
I could turn back the hands)
(If I could turn back) Just turn back that little clock on the wall (If I could
turn back) Then I'd come to realize how much, I love you (If I could turn back
the hands)
(If I could turn back) Love you (If I could turn back) Love you (If I could
turn back the hands) Love you
Love you (If I could turn back) (If I could turn back) (If I could turn back
the hands)


I don't understand, I do all this for you
You contemplating on me or is it him?
Or is it me? Or is it him?
He told you he'd be there for you and he wasn't
I told you I'd be there for you and I was And still is the real is who takes
care of biz Took you from apartments and got you home like the wiz
I'm not the kind of guy to give you everything But if you're real then you can
get some ice in your rings You and me straight to the crib off the tour bus
Spottin' my eyes fireplace big as us
It really don't matter, who's first in the shower Fruit platter from a young
maid every hour And when it comes down to the dollar You can have it all ya
gotta do is keep it hoppin' like a rabbit
Friends come around don't be ready to change Treat me like a stepchild when I'm
up on my game Remember I'm the first to give your cootie the pain So I wanna
hear you answer when I ask you my name
Ooh baby I want you here with me And give you everything that your heart
desires Lady can you feel me? Do you wanna be with me for always?
Baby can't you see what you've done to me? When he do the things that he has
done to you baby
You don't need nobody to love you You don't need nobody to kiss you You don't
need nobody to please you 'Cuz I can do those things if I'm with you
Now who took you in when that nigga put you out? And who picked you up when
that nigga put you down? Restraining orders keep that fool from around Had to
set you up in a spot downtown
See I was the one who was there for you But I'm not the one gonna play the two
Channel bags in the trunk, what you gon' do? You could treat the future like a
menu
As long as I'm the only one to bend you And when you wanna take a flight I'm
the one to send you Never be the one that's out to hurt you Tell you that I'm
there and then desert you
You don't need nobody to love you You don't need nobody to kiss you You don't
need nobody to please you 'Cuz I can do those things if I'm with you
You don't need nobody to love you You don't need nobody to kiss you You don't
need nobody to please you 'Cuz I can do those things if I'm with you
Baby, can't you see what you've done to me? When he do the things he do to you,
baby
You don't need nobody to love you You don't need nobody to kiss you You don't
need nobody to please you 'Cuz I can do those things if I'm with you
You don't need nobody to love you You don't need nobody to kiss you You don't
need nobody to please you 'Cuz I can do those things if I'm with you
You don't need nobody to love you You don't need nobody to kiss you You don't
need nobody to please you 'Cuz I can do those things if I'm with you
You don't need nobody to love you You don't need nobody to kiss you You don't
need nobody to please you

Soon as I see her walk up in the club Im a flirt
Winkin eyes at me when I roll up on them dubs Im a flirt
Sometimes when I'm with my chick on the low Im a flirt
And when she's with her man lookin at me damn right Im a flirt
So homie don't bring your girl to meet me cause Im a flirt And baby don't
bring your girlfriend to eat cause Im a flirt Please believe it unless your

When I'm livin the life, you just gettin' it right Your old lady look at me
cause you ain't hittin' it right She probably used to like you 'cause you the
business type That's until I came along and put some **** in her life
Wanna say, had an ***, **** a **** in the lights And I noticed she was checkin

even make her mine if I hit that right
You know smack that thang, sit that right Up on that dress, say yeah that's

tight but it'll spread just right
So if yo girl sexy and she pass me Don't be upset G cause you might catch me
Tryin to catch a glance up her skirt Then we playin in reverse If I see her
and I like her then I'ma flirt
When I, when I, when I When I pull up to club all the shawties be like, Damn!
28's! Then I be like, "Girl you know just who I am, don't hate" Say I done
fell in love wit a stripper yall All I do is flirt with her and I get them

And now I got to back this thing on up
I was just a touch away From playing the fool for you Till you lost my trust

I was just a touch away From playing the fool for you Till you lost my trust
And now I got to back this thing on up
I was just a touch away From playing the fool for you Till you lost my trust
And now I got to back this thing on up, babe
I was just a touch away From playing the fool for you Till you lost my trust
And now I got to back this thing on up
Having never lived like a lap full of G's When all the time you was just trying
trap me Closer, and closer, and closer to me Trying to get rooted like the
ground and trees
Now I wanna get tight like the harmonies All you wanna do is just scheme,
scheme, scheme Riding in my gators sittin' on my things Drinking and smoking up
all my
I was just a touch away From playing the fool for you Till you lost my trust

I've been kickin' it with your girlfriend, what am I gonna do?
'Cause, God knows that I really didn't mean to hurt you
I know it's bogus, but I felt that you should know the truth
I fell in love with her the moment we were introduced
And I just feel that it's time for this little secret to end Baby, I'm kickin'
it with your girlfriend
Oh, oh, oh
Go on and slap me again, 'cause I can understand how you feel When a man takes
you for granted and he don't keep it real I should've been more man and told
you a long time ago Instead of stunnin', I should have broke it down and let
you know
Girl, my fault for that, don't know what's on my mind And I blame myself for
wastin' your time Believe, I really tried to keep that girl away from me But
her body language kept on temptin' and teasin' me
And plus, she knew what she was doing and did it anyway I knew what she was
doing, too, and that made it okay Truth is that we don't even regret it Up out
the closet, I will be the first to say it
I've been kickin' it with your girlfriend, what am I gonna do? 'Cause, God
knows that I really didn't mean to hurt you I know it's bogus, but I felt that
you should know the truth
I fell in love with her the moment we were introduced And I just feel that it's
time for this little secret to end Baby, I'm kickin' it with your girlfriend
Oh, oh, oh
Now, I apologize for me and her and everything that went down These are the
reasons why some girls don't bring they friends around I just didn't know how
to tell I was feelin' her And how we would get away sometimes and make love
I never wanted to mislead you At first I just wanted to please you I know it's
hard for you to be able to trust again 'Cause I came between you and your best
friend
I did not ask for this It just happened outta no where since the day we kissed
And, the truth is that we don't even regret it Up out the closet, I will be the
first to say it
I've been kickin' it with your girlfriend, what am I gonna do? 'Cause, God
knows that I really didn't mean to hurt you I know it's bogus, but I felt that
you should know the truth
I fell in love with her the moment we were introduced And I just feel that it's
time for this little secret to end Baby, I'm kickin' it with your girlfriend
Oh, I'm sorry again, never meant to hurt you I'm sorry again but girl, I love
her I'm sorry again, I never meant to make you cry, no Now I'm right out the
closet
I've been kickin' it with your girlfriend, what am I gonna do? 'Cause, God
knows that I really didn't mean to hurt you I know it's bogus, but I felt that
you should know the truth
I fell in love with her the moment we were introduced And I just feel that it's
time for this little secret to end Baby, I'm kickin' it with your girlfriend
I've been kickin' it with your girlfriend, what am I gonna do? 'Cause, God
knows that I really didn't mean to hurt you I know it's bogus, but I felt that
you should know the truth I fell in love with her the moment we were introduced

Arguing through the night Pushing on people and starting fights I was fucked
up, I confess People saying Kellz is a hot mess
Even after that I was taking shots Shot after shot Shot after shot then I
couldn't even open the door to my Benz
Dropped off and I get in the door now Lying on the stairs snoring now Why you

those streets
You took my heart And you set it on fire And now my love forever burns You keep
taking me higher
I've been looking for love In all the wrong places And now I finally found
Someone who cares for me
No matter the storm It was you who helped me face it And now it's safe to say
That you really care for me
Just like the wings, you took me, flew me away, yeah And now my ground Is
underneath my feet
This man had nowhere to go Then you gave me direction And now the rest of my
days I can't help but give you the praise
I've been looking for love In all the wrong places And now I finally found
Someone who cares for me
No matter the storm It was you who helped me face it And now it's safe to say
That you really care for me
You saw my needs, forgave my faults You cleansed my heart, you changed my
thoughts You brought the sun into my life When my world had seemed dark, yes
you did
And you're the only one Who was there when I needed a friend You're the only
one who can place joy When there's pain in my heart
I've been looking for love In all the wrong places And now I finally found
Someone who cares for me
No matter the storm It was you who helped me face it And now it's safe to say
That you really care for me
I've been looking for love In all the wrong places And now I finally found
Someone who cares for me
No matter the storm It was you who helped me face it And now it's safe to say
That you really care for me
I've been looking for love In all the wrong places

Shoot ball, now I'm off to the spa Fresh an' clean, now I'm off in the car Got
a date with a superstar We take lunch, now twelve o'clock
Hit the mall 'bout two o'clock In the movies 'bout five o'clock Seven o'clock

Gettin' this money, switchin' my whips an' my kicks Like I'm just addicted to
difference, you pick what you want from me To be a lame with visions of riches,
enter my brain Like I picture myself in deep dishes, just switchin' lanes
It's just insane, is it? I'm from the district Where niggaz either in prison or
pay visits like in-laws So we fend for ourself an' the wealth is in raw We
can't help but been lost, what else gon' make that engine roar?

eyes When you gettin' that money, my nigga

Money makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round
TM
Yo, for those who live the way that I live We came a long way From wiping coal
outta eyelids to rap's hottest Fake Gazelles to black Pradas
Selling nicks to trey bags to making hits like Kidada Jones' father OG's would
send me to the store with a dollar Hit me with some wise advice for me to
follow Ain't nothing free in the world in life
No matter who you are, everybody got their price And some cost more than others
When you poor, it's like life ain't even worth living But when you rich, it's
every fat ass worth hittin'
With no chips, your drawers just stay on your hips I play with the six 'cuz
money make the whole world spin But without the franklin faces, you see who's
your real friends It's V-12's, honeys on the cell, bobbin' out the JBL, it's
Nas and R. Kell
Never thought that I'd ever live this life Money stacked in rolls, honeys on
each side Anything I want, I can say it's mine No more worries 'bout how can I
provide
Money makes the world go round You believe it if you want to Money makes the
world go round
Many say it's wrong 'cuz I love to spend Ice in everything countin' Benjamin's
All I wanna do, try and let you know If you don't believe, ask someone who's
broke
Money makes the world go round You believe it if you want to Money makes the
world go round Yes, it does
Said, money makes the world go round Nothing but the money makes the world go
round Yes, it does
Feels so good, yeah, yeah (So good, this life I finally live) And it feels so
real, oh, freedom (So real this freedom I finally feel) Show me the money
Money makes the world go round You believe it if you want to Money makes the
world go round
Said that almighty dollar Money makes the world go round Yes, it does
This brother's got to have it From sun up till the sun goes down (Money makes
the world go round) Yeah, so much money
(Money makes the world go round) Much money, much money Hey, it makes the world
go round, yeah (Money makes the world go round)
Show me a man that don't need money (Money makes the world go round) And I'll
show you a world standing still, oh (Money makes the world go round)
Yes, it does, talking 'bout the loot (Money makes the world go round)

That's the day I'll stop loving you
C'mon
If I have only one day on this earth whoa I'll live tonight, I'll spend
tonight, make love tonight I'll sleep tonight with you by my side And if I have
only one day on this earth whoa Then I'll laugh tonight, I'll cry tonight, I'll
make it right Spend the rest of my time with you by my side
If my time was slipping away And I didn't have long to live I'd appreciate the
time we've shared And I won't want you to shed a tear If the road was coming to
an end And I couldn't turn this car around I know faith will get us, get us
through the wind And I'll be somewhere on heaven's ground
If I have only one day on this earth whoa I'll live tonight, I'll spend
tonight, make love tonight I'll sleep tonight with you by my side And if I have
only one day on this earth whoa Then I'll laugh tonight, I'll cry tonight, I'll
make it right Spend the rest of my time with you by my side

know our love made history And know that life is a better place If there's
nothing on the television That the world was gonna end today Girl I'll be on a

la la la la la la la la la
Anticipate you grace to stage
begin to play that stunning way
all eyes on u , wearing all black suit
the crowd goes silent in this place  piano keys, the melodies  that you select
it´s teasing me

Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
Playas get lonely too, too
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
Playas get lonely too, too
From my iPhone to my sidekick Jet planes, schedule hectic My love life, I
neglect it Had a fast car but I wrecked it
Plenty chances to fall in love, man So many weekends I went to clubs, man In
the fast lane my life's a picture flick Let my drink decide who is the next
chick
I ain't gone lie, on the plane it don't matter to me She say she me love me but
it's just chit chatter to me But deep inside I was always missing something But
I'm a thug so I'm always on something
So many girls always drinking and having fun Life's a beauty shop and I keep my
hair done Seems like I'm on a merry-go-round And it make a thug wanna settle
down
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes Playas get lonely too, too Sometimes,
sometimes, sometimes Playas get lonely too, too
Im gonna settle down with you, baby you and me A life that's brand new, quit
running these streets Take away your pain, chase away the rain Off my love
game, I might even change my name
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes Playas get lonely too, too Sometimes,
sometimes, sometimes Playas get lonely too, too
Uh, uh V.I.P., uh, uh R O B Always in the spot light Living the good life All
of that, somethin still just ain't right
Videos and all of these interviews When all I really want is to be next to you
I spend more time with my car now Land of the Hollywood sign, I'm a star now
My life is more than the cars and awards It gets lonely and I can't ignore
Always in the streets going hardcore I spend a couple of G's when I'm bored
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes Playas get lonely too, too Sometimes,
sometimes, sometimes Playas get lonely too, too
Party nights mixed with lonely nights Mixed with first class flights mixed with
Uh, nobody to share it with, no
Above all after parties I still need somebody To be there when a playas going
through some shit To be there when a playa can't ever see
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes Playas get lonely too, too Sometimes,
sometimes, sometimes Playas get lonely too, too
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes Playas get lonely too, too Sometimes,
sometimes, sometimes Playas get lonely too, too
Playas get lonely R O B, 12 play 4th quarter

Now I was in a real bad abusive relationship Knowing that, there was no way for
me to live A young girl like me, raised up in a good family Way too young to
endure such misery And every night I cry myself to sleep from all the pain And
the more I prayed for sunny days it seemed to rain
(He hit me) At any given time (He hit me) No reason at all (He hit me) So, so
hard (He hit me) My God, sometimes I'd fall
Mama asked what happened to me and I'd take up for him She said that devil's a
liar and pray get rid of him And now I'm going to school, hitting those books

I was a freshman in college and uh I had just made it on the basketball team I
had all the skills it took to make it But on my grades, I would get nothing but
all D's And the coach came to me And had a talk with me about my career
Said if you don't get your grades up I'm gonna have to sit you down this year
Man as tough as I was, I break down and cried 'Cause everybody knows me Knows
that basketball is my life
(Algebra) I studied hard (Chemistry) I gave my all (Calculus) Oh my God
(English) So many flaws
Playing ball didn't look to good for me My future, could not see, I had lost
all my beliefs And gave up on all my dreams Then I went to church on Sunday And
the pastor began to preach It was like he was talking to me When he said, I can
do all things
In Christ that strengthens me and for me that was enough Now that I went from a
D all the way to an A plus I tell you prayer changes things

Me and my wife had a few problems We thought that nothing could solve them
Listening to family members and so called friends Man I tell you that's just
how the devil creeps in
We were separated at least for a month or two She was wilding in the clubs And
I was out there doing wrong too And we would walk around the house Putting each
other down I mean right in front of the kids We would curse each other out
Then I was in a bad accident and almost lost my life And guess who was there
for me, my wife Now ain't it funny how He makes a way When we said there was no
way I'm out the hospital and back at home Planning another wedding day, I tell
you

there's nothing God can't achieve I don't care what the problem in your life
may be 'Cause who the Son sets free, is free indeed And if you didn't know, now
you should know All you got to do is take this family's life for example

low  Living that double life  It ain't right
I don't believe the shit I did the night we were at your mom's I got a page
from out of town, lied and said it was my job Grabbed my hat, coat, gloves and
scarf I told you that I would return But by the look upon your face you had
already discerned You pulled me to the side and you begged for me to stay But I
was caught up in a life that forced me to walk away
Repeat 1
Okay you, you're saying you came in and And these two women they, they poured
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, it wasn't nothing like that All I know is uh, I was

With a cigar in my mouth over Vegas city lights [ From: http://
 On a path way up the hill to
be with my other wife A rich nigga living strife going on like nothing's wrong
But that damn Caller ID is the reason for this song So one called up the other
while I was out playing some golf Talking 'bout my doggish ways and how I need
to be droppped off
Repeat 1
Now go ahead, shoot me now because I'm guilty as sin Playin' Russian roulette
with hearts not to mention the kids Now every day I live I regret all that I
did Out smoking with friends as I reminisced
Repeat 1
I can't take it no more I've got to confess See now, I don't know why I thought
that I could keep creeping 'cause you see what goes around Comes back on around
and back on around And back on around again, yes it does Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh In a state of shock that's what it left me Take it from a
man who knows That three ain't company No, no, no that's what I kept telling
myself Now I done lost the houses the kids and the dogs Now I'm sleeping in my
momma's house And even she says, your sorry ass don't deserve no help Must be
because of what my old man did to her Niggas Rockland

Baby, is it all right if I break it down
And give you something romantic?
I figured since it's raining
This would be the perfect time for us
Can you hear the sounds of the Love angels calling us? Sweet violins and harps
playing Then suddenly there's this kiss of trust
Dapper than the morning dew Tonight has chosen me and you And girl I vow to
make everyone Of your fantasies come true
I can hear, horns sounding, bells ringing A full orchestra and a choir singing
The oceans calm and the rivers flowing It feels so good, keep on going
Raindrops keep falling on our heads, as we make love We won't stop, the rain
keeps falling down on both of us Raindrops keep falling on our heads, as we
make love We won't stop, the rain keeps falling down on both of us
Can you see the flowers blooming Slowly as the seasons change The gift of joy
is founded When I softly hear you call my name
Rose petals and all these oils Surrounded by 100 candles An eagle delivers a
letter that says The night will last forever
Dapper than the morning dew Tonight has chosen me and you And girl I promise to
make everyone Of your fantasies come true
I can hear, horns sounding, bells ringing A full orchestra and a choir singing
The oceans calm and the rivers flowing Don't you stop, keep on going
Raindrops keep falling on our heads, as we make love We won't stop, the rain
keeps falling down, on both of us Raindrops keep falling on our heads, as we
make love We won't stop, the rain keeps falling down, on both of us
Through all the trees, the smooth wind blows Then suddenly a rainbow And an
ocean filled with white sailboats And huge waterfalls that overflow

Do I know your friend who? At a club?
Who was there? Girl, I wouldn't
Wait a minute, calm down, I was at a club with who?
Get tha fuck, man, you know what?
Girl, I'm not about to sit up here and argue with you About who's to blame or
call no names, real talk See girl, only thing I'm tryin' to establish with you
is not Who's right or who's wrong But what's right and what's wrong, real talk
Just because your friend say She saw me at a club with some other bitches
Sittin' in VIP, smokin' and drinkin' And kickin' it, tell me, girl
Did she say there were other guys there? Did she say there were other guys
there? Were there other guys there? Well, tell me this
How the fuck she knew I was with them other girls then When the whole club
packed? Wait a minute, let me finish what I've got to say
I've been with you five years And you listenin' to your motherfuckin'
girlfriends I don't know why you fuck with them old jealous No man havin' ass
hoes anyway, real talk
Alway accusin' me of some old bullshit When I'm just tryin' to have a good time
Robert, you did this, Kells, I heard you did that Don't you think I got enough
bullshit on my mind, real talk
Hold, hold up Didn't I just give you money to go get your hair Toes and nails
done the other day, hmm? Yeah, your ass was smilin' then, real talk
Gave who some damn money? I ain't gave nobody no damn money, girl, is you
tweakin'? You see what your problem is You're always runnin' off at the mouth
Tellin' your girls your motherfuckin' business
When they don't eat with us, they don't sleep with us Besides, what they eat
don't make us shit, real talk You called my momma's house and what? Girl, my
momma ain't gotta screen no calls for me, real talk And watch your mouth, fuck
me? Girl, fuck you!
I don't give a fuck about what you're talkin' about I'm sick of this bullshit,
I'm comin' home And gettin' my shit and gettin' the fuck up outta Dodge You
ain't gotta worry about me no more
And the next time your ass get horny Go fuck one of your funky ass friends Hell
yeah, you probably already doin' that shit anyway You gonna burn what? Bitch, I
wish you would burn my motherfuckin' clothes
With your triflin' ass, Milton, you bogus girl, Milton Start your car, warm it
up and get ready to take me home This bitch done lost her motherfuckin' mind


She didnt have a house, a house up in the hills
I never heard her ask for some car with the chromed out wheels
But all she wanted was some love and affection
But all I did all the time was neglect
The fact that she was lonely, I used to be her homey I used to talk about how I
was gonna get us out of the hood But as long as were together as a family,
then its all good
Because any man can make a baby But it takes a real man to be a father Talking
bout a family, the kid, you and me Its not a fantasy, but its reality You
see love is wrong and love is right But if love is strong then love is tight
Talking bout a chemistry like a bride-to-be Its not a fantasy, but its
reality
Be careful were the words the last time we had our talk And your truth sound
absurd so my pride just let you walk When all the time knowin' that I didnt
mean To holler out and call you, 'Bitch' and tell you leave I admit it, I was
wrong, but now its over, come on home I cant take it, here is where you
belong
Even out the window looking for the mailman I hope hes got a letter says, "Im
missing you", in the mail And then I saw you with another Made it hard for me
to breathe But when I played the game for gives I shouldve played the game for
keeps
Because any man can make a baby But it takes a real man to be a father Talking
bout a family, the kid, you and me Its not a fantasy, but its reality You
see love is wrong and love is right But if love is strong then love is tight
Talking bout a chemistry like a bride-to-be Its not a fantasy, but its
reality
Now I wore the shoes that you talked about in the song But its been a change
Ive got a new pair on, yes Now every night and day I still await At the lonely
spot in the hills and think about How you set the record straight Any man can
Any man can make a baby But it takes a real man to be a father Talking bout a
family, the kid, you and me Its not a fantasy, but its reality You see love
is wrong and love is right But if love is strong then love is tight Talking
bout a chemistry like a bride-to-be Its not a fantasy, but its reality
Any man can make a baby But it takes a real man to be a father Talking bout a
family, the kid, you and me Its not a fantasy, but its reality You see love
is wrong and love is right But if love is strong then love is tight Talking
bout a chemistry like a bride-to-be Its not a fantasy, but its reality
Any man can make a baby But it takes a real man to be a father Talking bout a
family, the kid, you and me Its not a fantasy, but its reality You see love
is wrong and love is right

{This goes out to all of those that were lost in Virginia
Parents, families, friends, we light a candle
And let you know that Virginia will rise again}
I know you're feeling pain right now
And you don't wanna talk right now I know you're going through something And
you don't wanna be bothered right now
Not gonna lie and say I understand I just wanna be here for you if I can To
hold your hand and be by your side And together we will get through these times

And we will cry together And we'll fight this together And we'll be strong
together Stand together, pray together
Rise up, when you feel you can't go on Rise up, when all of your hope is gone
Rise up, when you're weak and you can't be strong Rise up
Rise up, and when the tears start to fall Rise up, and you feel you've given it
your all Rise up, when your back is up against the wall Rise, rise up
Now I know the burdens that you've had And you don't think nobody cares A storm
comes out of nowhere And you're feeling like it just ain't fair
Not here to preach about the private side, no 'Cause I understand and now is
not the time See I just wanna help you make it right Walk with you, holding the
candle light
And we will cry together And we'll fight this together And we'll be strong
together Stand together, pray together
Rise up, when you feel you can't go on Rise up, when all of your hope is gone
Rise up, when you're weak and you can't be strong Rise up
Rise up, and when the tears start to fall Rise up, and you feel you've given it
your all Rise up, when your back is up against the wall Rise
You see struggle, struggle has No color, no color In the midst of crisis You
are my sister and I'm your brother
And side by side we'll face this thing Standing tall, you and me
Rise up, rise Rise up, rise
Rise up, rise (Hey we gon' rise) Rise up (Heads up to to the sky)
Rise up, rise (When all hope is gone) Rise up, rise (We'll stand tall and
believe)
Rise up, rise (And we gotta know tomorrow will come) Rise (And we will have a
victory)
Rise up, rise (Hey, rise up) Rise up, rise (Hey)
Rise up, rise (In the middle, in the middle of your storm when you) Rise (When
you think you, when you think you cannot make it, rise up)
Rise up, rise (God bless you Virginia) Rise up, rise (Our hearts go out to you
and your families)
Rise up, rise Rise up
Rise up

This song goes out to my mother
The one I love and the one I lost
When it comes down to her
Thinkin' about what my mother's done for me
The love she's given me It makes it easy to do some thing like this So this
one's for you ma I love you
Early one Sunday morning Breakfast was on the table There was no time to eat
She said to me, "Boy hurry to Sunday school"
Filled with the long of glory We learned the holy story She'll always have her
dreams Despite the things this troubled world can bring
Oh Sadie, don't you know we love you sweet Sadie Place no one above you sweet
Sadie Well well well Living in the past
Sometimes it seems so funny No money can turn your life around Sweeter than
cotton candy Stronger than papas' old brandy Always that needed smile Once in
awhile she would break down and cry
Sometimes she'd be so happy Being with us and daddy Standing the worst of times
Breaking the binds with just a simple song
Oh Sadie maiden She's loving my song in a special way Well, well, well Sweet
Sadie Living in the past
Oh she's never sinning In love she's always winning yeah My my my my my I Love
you mama
I just can't forget how you gave me love, oh no If there's a Heaven up above I
know she's teaching angels how to love Its a mean world without you And I
surely miss you much mother
And now that your gone I'm gonna carry on 'Cause your cryin' lady, woh Sadie
When I think about the things that you done for me Hey it brings a joy way down
deep inside of me, yeah woh
See I love you mama Yes I do I'll never forget you mother No oh ho, no oh ho

Rock land, hova (Yes, yes)
Now, somebody's girl is in my mansion Shakin' that ass to this And somebody's
girl is in my hot tub Drinkin' that glass of Crist'
And somebody's girl is in my bedroom And man, she's a superfreak And somebody's
girl is leavin' my crib Now on to the next booty
I don't mean no harm But your boy got the magic stick, the Don Juan Bishop,
chicks'll disappear in thin air Like mist or some shit like this, I swear
I take handcuffs off misses, I pick locks wicked I catch your eye 'coz my tick-
tock's frigid My necklace glisten, all reckless chicks is eyeballin' yeah And I
caught 'em like perfect pitches
Call me Mike Piazza Once I get 'em in my fly casa It's hot tubs, heated pools
and no rules Call your old dude and tell him he old news
Tell that fella you feel like Cinderella With both shoes and it's almost two
Fuck a storybook endin', we bendin' the rules This is somebody's girl part two,

You're rotatin' with a guy that spend money like the world spin 'round First

Yes it's true that I believe
I'm weaker than I used to be
I wear my heart out on my sleeve
Oh, and I forget the rest of me
Yes, there's times I've been afraid And there's no harm in that I pray 'Cause
I'm more frightened everyday Someone will take the hope I have, away
But you gotta give it up To get off sometimes You gotta give it up To get off
sometimes You gotta give it up To get off sometimes I know
You gotta give it up To get off sometimes You gotta give it up To get off
sometimes You gotta give it up To get off sometimes I know
All the times I've given in You fit me like a second skin And one by one I will
begin To wear you on the days I'm feeling thin
But you gotta give it up To get off sometimes You gotta give it up To get off
sometimes You gotta give it up To get off sometimes I know
Hey, I gotta give it up To get off sometimes You gotta give it up To get off
sometimes You gotta give it up To get off sometimes I know
You'd better stop, stop, stop Using me up You'd better stop 'Cause I've had
enough And I'm ready to forget the reasons That keep me here
Ooh in the rain You won't even if you never even gonna change Good god need a
little help, while You'll find what you think you gonna be child
Ya, you'd better stop, stop, stop Using me up You'd better stop 'Cause I've had
enough And I'm ready to forget the reasons Well the reasons keepin' me here


I was in a tunnel
And couldn't see the light
And whenever I'd look up
I couldn't see the sky
Sometimes when I'm standin' It seems like I done walked for miles And my heart
could be cryin' Dead in the middle of a smile
But then I climbed the hills And saw the mountains I hollered help 'cause I was
lost Then I felt the strong wind Heard a small voice sayin'
The storm is over (The storm is over now) And I can see the sunshine (Somewhere
beyond the clouds) I feel Heaven, yeah (Heaven is over me) Come on and set me
free, whoa
Now in the midst of my battle All hope was gone Downtown in a rushed crowd And
felt all alone And every now and then I felt like I would lose my mind I've
been racin' for years And still no finish line, oh
But then I climbed the hills And saw the mountains (Mountains) I hollered help
'cause I was lost Then I felt the strong wind [ From: http://
 And then a small voice
sayin'
The storm is over (The storm is over now) And I can see the sunshine (Somewhere
beyond the clouds) I can feel Heaven, yeah (Heaven is over me)
Come on and set me free
Somehow my beginning stepped right in (Right in) Then faith became my friend
(My friend) And now I can depend On the voices of the wind When it's sayin'
(Sayin')
The storm is over (The storm is over now) And I can see the sunshine (Somewhere
beyond the clouds) I can feel Heaven, yeah (Heaven is over me)
Won't you come and set me free Won't you set me free
The storm is over (The storm is over now) And I can see the sunshine (Somewhere
beyond the clouds) I can feel Heaven, yeah (Heaven is over me) Won't you come
and set me free

Said the easiest thing in the world
Is to love you
And the hardest thing in the world
Is to lose you
Said I tried and tried again to keep you But it just ain't no use
I'm baffled 'cuz of what went down See I got your letter so you're leavin' town
Just take one minute to think about Baby, let's back track on what happened in
this house
Now I remember clearly it was a Saturday I came walkin' in, four o'clock in the
mornin' And I thought you were sleepin', one eye open You turned and said to me
where the hell you been
Then I turned it around and hollered With some friends drinkin' And now I'm
sittin' here all alone Wishing you were here to house this home, oh
Say the easiest thing in the world Is to love you But the hardest thing in the
world Is to lose you
And now I'm sitting here sippin' on things I'm not suppose to And that ain't
cool I've got to get over losing you
Shattered, can't believe you're gone I'm left in the middle of these four walls
Lyin' helpless, 'bout to lose my mind, baby I can't fathom life without you by
my side
Now every night before I go to sleep I pray to heaven for a better me Nights
I'm up thinkin' and days I'm up dreamin' You were at work, I was at play
A nigga wanted you and plus his cake I know I ain't got no right to say But I
need you to head on back this way Because I'm sittin' here all alone Wishing
you were here to house this home
Say the easiest thing in the world Is to love you And the hardest thing in the
world Is to lose you
And now I'm sitting here sippin' on things That I'm not suppose to And woman
you know that ain't cool I've got to get over Baby can't we just moan for love
Like we used to
Say the easiest thing in the world Is to love you But the hardest thing in the
world Is to lose you
So I'm sitting here sippin' on things That I'm not suppose to Contemplating,
you know that ain't cool That ain't cool, ain't right mama But I just can't
seem to get over
See, sometimes we men, we can dish it out But sometimes we men, we can't take
it and hey So I'm gonna get up out this chair And catch me a train and get
where you are, hey
Because I love you baby And I need you right here by my side Ghetto woman, come
on home to me I'm dyin' sorry and I can't seem to break free


Girl, you know, you knock me out
You're a real girl with your looks now baby
Girl you know, you knock me out
Summer bunnies drive me crazy
Summer bunnies drive me crazy Summer bunnies drive me crazy Summer bunnies

bet It's summertime so it's time to get a summer These summers, goes and I
won't call them, whores
'Cause in the 90's you gotta respect the ladies So step up to 'em and say, We
love you sweet Sadie That's how you get your true mock on but Brothers be
steppin' up poppin' that sad song
Hey don't I know you from somewhere? Can we go somewhere to be alone? I pull up

get a summer bunny
Summer bunnies drive me crazy Summer bunnies drive me crazy Summer bunnies

to make a move I'm on my way to a picnic
But I wanna be early, fool So I can catch the new bunnies comin' in Like the
old school
Strollin' the block so I can check the scenery The sun plays, the day is
feelin' good to me I can just smell the funky beats You know the flavor in
between the sheets
I told My boy Big Al, said Just keep it straight He said, I know I got a
novelty to validate So who's the bunny lookin' sweet like a honeycomb? He
said, No my brother, you got to get your own
Summer bunnies drive me crazy Summer bunnies drive me crazy Summer bunnies
drive me crazy Summer bunnies drive me crazy
This party is packed, word to the mother I love it when there's three bunnies
to one brother And wine coolers is what I'm packin' And when I get my buzz on
is when I start bunny-jackin'
Jackin' fools for their bunnies 'Cause I'm the K, the E, the double L, the Y
They wanna get with me and the PAs in the house So check, check, check it out
My stomach is growlin' so it's time to get mine on Some soul food, cool Aid and
you know it's on I hate to eat and run but I'm out my homie Been invited to a
block party, so we roll up in all our style With the brothers yellin', summer
bunnies
Summer bunnies drive me crazy Summer bunnies drive me crazy Summer bunnies

seam and her favorite ass jeans Y'all know the first date wearers
To make objects bigger than they appear like a rear-view mirror Oh, her shoe
 With the four-
inch heels
But honestly my favorite type of gear Is a scrungy for her hair and LaPearla
underwear, clear?
Girl, I hear you callin', let's stop stallin' Do what we came to do Girl I hear
you callin', let's stop stallin' Baby I want you, yeah
Girl, you know you got a body-adi-adi (Do you like it?) Where you get your
little body-adi-adi (Do you want it?)
Girl I wanna freak your body-adi-adi (What you want it?) I just wanna take you
home with me


Bright nights, street lights in a city that never sleeps
Loud music and talks, people where all the party seems
I saw a girl and I notice that she noticed me
We sipped mojitos, then she told me all about her dreams
Then we made love in a taxi cab It reminded me of a dream I had Now the
memory's like a photograph, ooh babe And I can't get her out of my head, oh
Made love in a taxi cab, taxi cab, taxi cab Made love in a taxi cab, taxi cab,
taxi cab Made love in a taxi cab, taxi cab And I surely know she's there
I come alone, I come alone, oh, that's what she said I come alone, I come
alone, oh
Looking at the rearview she said to me, let go and be free Then she told the
driver mind his business and then went there on me Then I told her we're just
15 minutes from my home But she didn't stop, she kept saying it feels so
incredibly wrong
And we made love in a taxi cab It reminded me of a dream I had Now the memory's
like a photograph, ooh, baby girl And I can't get her out of my head, oh
Last night, made, made love in a taxi cab, taxi cab, taxi cab Last night, made
love in a taxi cab, taxi cab, taxi cab Last night, made love in a taxi cab,
taxi cab Last night and I surely know she's there
And it all happened so soon, girl I didn't even get a name, she took control
and had her way Oh I, and it was like a hotel room, yeah We're taking a gamble
what people love to pay
Oh, we made love in a taxi cab It reminded me of a dream I had Now the memory's
like a photograph, baby And I can't get her out of my head
Oh, last night made love in a taxi cab, taxi cab, taxi cab Last night made love
in a taxi cab, taxi cab, taxi cab Last night made love in a taxi cab, taxi cab
Last night and I surely know she's there
Last night made love in a taxi cab, taxi cab, taxi cab Last night made love in
a taxi cab, taxi cab, taxi cab Last night made love in a taxi cab, taxi cab,
taxi cab
Then we made love in a taxi cab, taxi cab, taxi cab It reminded me of a dream I
had Now the memory's like a photograph, baby And I can't get her out of my
head, ooh babe


What's up baby?
I know what you're thinking
What did I call you over here for?
I wanna take you somewhere
Tempo slow, lights down low Let me take you to a place Where only love grooves
go
Step into my territory and let the vibes begin Don't be afraid, just let this
love groove in Let the passion lead you to a place beyond Exploring my bedroom,
having freaky fun

go
Where all the players go And all the gangstas go
Tempo slow, lights down low Let me take you to a place Where only love grooves

start to flow Makin' sweet love till the morning light And satisfying love's
appetite

go
Where all the players go And all the gangstas go

secrets unknown Time to taste what love has in store for me So let's take a sip

Look behind myself
As I reflect on all the memories
Good times, they come and go Lost everything from friends to family
If I could turn back the hands There would be some things I'd change about me I
know that my past is not what my future holds
Where I come from who could believe All the pain and misery? Look in my eyes
and you'll see The diary of me, of me
Rewind my life Just go back and correct all the wrong And ask God to direct my
path So that I can make it home
And if I could turn back the hands of time There would be some things I would
change about me But I know that my past is not what my future holds
'Cause where I'm from who could believe All the pain, misery Look in my eyes
and you will see The diary of me
Years ago a child was born And raised without a man My mother's gone But still
reached out her hand
Just open the book Turn the pages of my life And you will read A true story
about one man's journey
Where I'm from who would believe, yeah That all the hurt and pain and misery?
Look in my eyes and you'll see The diary of me
Where I'm from who could believe The hurt and pain and misery? Look in my eyes
and you will see The makings of my diary
Where I'm from who could believe The hurt and pain and misery? Look in my eyes
and you will see The makings of my diary
Where I'm from who could believe?

I was in a tunnel
And couldn't see the light
And whenever I'd look up
I couldn't see the sky
Sometimes when I'm standin' It seems like I done walked for miles And my heart
could be cryin' Dead in the middle of a smile
But then I climbed the hills And saw the mountains I hollered help 'cause I was
lost Then I felt the strong wind Heard a small voice sayin'
The storm is over The storm is over now And I can see the sunshine Somewhere
beyond the clouds I feel Heaven, yeah Heaven is over me Come on and set me free

Now in the midst of my battle All hope was gone Downtown in a rushed crowd And
felt all alone Every now and then I felt like I would lose my mind I've been
racin' for years And still no finish line, oh
But then I climbed the hills And saw the mountains I hollered help 'cause I was
lost Then I felt the strong wind And then a small voice sayin'
The storm is over The storm is over now And I can see the sunshine Somewhere
beyond the clouds I can feel Heaven, yeah Heaven is over me Come on and set me
free
Somehow my beginnin' stepped right in Then faith became my friend And now I can
depend On the voices of the wind When it's sayin'
The storm is over The storm is over now And I can see the sunshine Somewhere
beyond the clouds I can feel Heaven, yeah Heaven is over me Won't you come and
set me free? Won't you set me free?
The storm is over The storm is over now And I can see the sunshine Somewhere
beyond the clouds I can feel Heaven, yeah Heaven is over me Won't you come and
set me free?
Won't you come and set me free Just like, if that guy can see the light,
shinin' Somewhere beyond the clouds If that guy can see the light, shinin' Take
it down, down If that guy can see the light, shinin' The day is going, world is
runnin' The clouds moving, the sun shinin' I made it home, I made it home
Prayin' for a pot of gold
The storm is over now I'am telling you I could see the light Somewhere beyond
the clouds I can feel Heaven over me Heaven is over me Come and set me free
Come and set me free Won't you come and set me free?


Dear God, how can I explain myself?
Oh God, bless me indeed when I'm so confused
Enlarge my territory
Place Your love and protection over me at all times
Help me Keep me away from evil, somebody answer me Allow me not to cause pain
Police in the background, screamin', "Put the thing down" That's how hard I was
trying to put my thing down Sirens ringin' out, old ladies screamin' out All
this attention for me and I'm barely sixteen now
It's feelin' like a dream now Handcuffed, roughed up, I'm tossed in the bing
now I'm lyin' next to fiends now, that's the end of the story Let me bring
y'all niggaz back to the very first scene now
December 4th, a child is born Before I knew it, had my pops trousers on That's
how we do it when the man of the house is gone You either stand or fall, I
chose to stand
The hawk outside, so I blow my hand It's a cold, cold world but I overstand
Tryin' to stay focused but I feel hopeless damn Can't cope with bein' broke,
I'm a man, c'mon
Son, don't let these streets, get the best of you I will be right by your side,
when you goin' through Son, just don't let it (Just don't let it) Just don't
let it (Just don't let it) Just don't let it (Just don't let it) Get the best
of you
Late one night I was rollin' the streets Just thinkin' about what's goin' on
with me And trapped in this thug life, tryin' to break free But this thug life
just keeps callin' me
I'm livin' life way too dangerously I'm drownin' in my misery Looked in the
mirror, there's my enemy 'Cause poppa never was a part of me
"Take one step at a time", mama said Sweet memories still remain in my head All
of my life been lied to, misled Voices be like, "Don't you wish you was dead?"
No ground to place my feet, I feel the fire under me A way out is all I need,
somebody, answer me
Son, don't let these streets, get the best of you I will be right by your side,
when you goin' through Son, just don't let it (Just don't let it) Just don't
let it (Just don't let it) Just don't let it (Just don't let it) Get the best
of you
Now the only thing left is more spirit to roam free 'Cause ain't no goin' home
for me It's a cold, cold world but I blew my hand A true first 'cause I knew
that man
I knew what he would do if I didn't draw first And I couldn't stand the thought
of My momma steppin' foot inside a church All I try to do is try to get up out
the dirt
Guess, he's tryin' to do the same Told me, get up out his turf I wanted to talk
to him but that shit'd never work
We was cut from the same cloth And what was under his shirt was his momma's
rent His young brother's clothes, my nephew's food And with that I suppose and
with that I froze
Now my life is frozen in time behind these iron folds And this story is told
for young soldiers Who never choose the life we chose
Son, don't let these streets, get the best of you I will be right by your side,
when you goin' through Son, just don't let it (Just don't let it) Just don't
let it (Just don't let it) Just don't let it (Just don't let it) Get the best
of you
Tears in my eyes as I look up I'm tryin' to hold back my pride but reality is
screamin' Gotta get a job 'cause momma also screamin' Streets are just like
drugs and it's like I'm out here fiendin'
Forget all the hits in the industry 'Cause ain't no exceptions in this game for
me Look, neither God or my enemies I choose God 'cause He understands
This young man with a thuggish heart Whole world in his hands but still torn
apart Like I'm so close but it's still so far Nightmares of me in a swervin'
car, oh
No ground to place my feet (My feet) I feel the fire under me (Hey) A way out
is all I need (All I need) Somebody answer me
Son, don't let these streets, get the best of you I will be right by your side,
when you goin' through Son, just don't let it (Just don't let it) Just don't
let it (Just don't let it) Just don't let it (Just don't let it) Get the best
of you

Shawty What You Saying (4x)

Girl, you just don't know
Last night was incredible
Yes
Check it out
Last night I felt the skies Open up and rain down Heaven Last night I felt the
sun The moon and stars come together
Last night I heard an Angel Speak to me and said "Us forever" And while we were
makin' love I saw visions of a tropical river, last night I
Touched a dream (You were here with me, last night I) Touched a dream (Girl,
you fulfill my fantasy)
Touched a dream (Said we rewrote the book of love-makin' history) Touched a
dream (Last night you brought my dreams to reality)
Now last night, I coulda sworn I saw an eagle spread his wings Last night I
heard a mass Quietly lift their voice and sing
Last night I saw the world Livin' in peace and harmony While we were makin'
love Felt my soul being set free, last night
Touched a dream (You were here with me, last night I) Touched a dream (You
fulfill my fantasy)
Touched a dream (I said we rewrote the book of love makin' history) Touched a
dream (Oh yeah, girl, you brought my dreams to reality)
After the rain comes the rainbow The sun will shine now even though it's cold
Oh, yes it will And mother nature guarantees it, yeah
Jumped the mountain and touched the sky Over the sea baby, we can fly When we
make love I see the flowers the trees, the birds, the bees Last night I touched
a dream
Touched a dream (Yeah, you were right here with me) Touched a dream (A dream)
Touched a dream (You fulfill my fantasy oh baby, yes you did)) Touched a dream
(Said we rewrote the book of love-makin' history)
Touched a dream (Girl, you brought my dreams to reality, yeah) Touched a dream
(There's nothin' when you are lying next to me)
Touched a dream (You fulfill my fantasy, yes you did) Touched a dream (And baby
we rewrote the book of love-makin' history)
If I ever I have a dream A vision of you right there with me I know you're my
love making queen And I am your love making king Let no man or woman come
between What God has given you and me
The laws of reciprocity The gift of amorocity Provided us with food to eat
Fills our vacancies Put together the perfect chemistry Forever anniversaries
You're the root to my tree I'm a branch you're a leaf The apple carrying my
seed Fall, winter, summer, spring That's why I ain't gon' let the Devil Steal
my joy from me 'cause I done
Touched a dream Touched a dream Touched a dream

Hit it hard from the back
Roll around on the front
I know you've heard a lot of tracks
But twelve play is what you want
Just let me call the studio Then we can go all night Girl I hope you can hang
'Cause I'm horny as hell tonight
One Taking off your secrets with my teeth Two Slightly rough to let you know
it's about to get kinky Three Blind your eyes, then I walk you to my bedroom
Four Now open your eyes Surprise you've entered twelve play two
Stop We need to catch our breath We've been going for a while It's been about
two hours And we're still going round for round The water's getting cold And
the movie's goin' off This is how we do in TP two
Five I'm about to take you for a ride Now feel it come inside Six Baby it's as
hard as a brick Tell me can you feel this ssh, ssh, ssh Seven That's when to
slow it down 'Cause I'm not ready to Eight We're almost at the peak 'Cause I'm
feeling tingly
Now flew your body like, what, what, what It's like diamonds with the cut, cut,
cut The hottest out of your friends The way you take it from me Girl you put it
on me like draws Moanin' when you talk I'm about to tear your shit out New
millennium style
Nine Lookin' you in your eyes As I'm about to do that thing Ten Then on down to
your thighs I'm gonna make you scream Eleven Now put your body on top of me I'm
about to grab your waist Twelve Now quick before we get to thirteen Set it on
my face

Trade in my life for you, for you Trade in my life for you, for you Trade in my

Believe it or not, I just started laughing
Shaking my head and just kept on laughing
Thinking about all the things I had been through that day
Then she cries, "What? Why do you have that smile upon your face?"
Then I laughed out, said "Thinking about all the things I been through" She
wipes her nose and she sniffles and laughs out "I been through it too"
Then I start laughing again And she start laughing more Then next thing you
know we're both are Cracking up on the floor
She laughs out, "I can't believe This idiot really answered my phone" Now
meanwhile Twon just got out of prison And he's on his way home
Then she yells, "Baby, I'm sorry for all the lies and all the bore" Then I say,
"Girl, just wait till I tell all the drama That I been dealing with" She
laughs, "I wanna hear it all"
Then I laugh and say, "Baby, first of all I got a hangover, been trapped in the
closet Slept with who knows, threatened to kill a pastor" She says, "What? Baby

through a lot, plus I got a ticket"
Meanwhile, the police, he turns around Just out of concern, comes back to the
house Then he pulls up in the driveway My car's parked with the lights on Then
he goes around the back way He hear the dog barking like somethings wrong
He gets to the back door And discovers it's been broken in He looks around,
pulls his gun out Then he proceeds in
Meanwhile, we're laughing and laughing and laughing From his perspective he
thinks that somebody's crying He gets closer to the bedroom and he would swear
That somebody's coughing and sighing
Meanwhile, we in the bedroom laughing As I'm trying to continue to explain She
yells out, "Sylvester your killing me" I said, "I swear baby it went that way
Then next thing you know he bust up in the room And say, "Mothafucker freeze"
And then I looked back up at him and said "Wait your that damn police"
Then she scream, "Baby, I mean James" She says "Everything is cool" And then he
yells, "Gwendolyn, I got this I know your sick and tired of this fool"
Then I stood up, started walking Toward him screaming, "Man, get out my house"
Then he yells, "Freeze" She scream, "Please"
Then I pull my biretta out Then she cried out "Sylvester please don't" Then I
started thinking about him making love to her He said, "Man, put the gun on the
floor" I can't stop thinking about him and her
I slowly put the gun down And then I put my hands up He winked at me and smiled
And that is when I went nuts
Hopped all over him round the gun She screaming, "Settle down" Going all around
the room Both hands on the gun and all of a sudden pow


Seven o'clock in the mornin'
And the rays from the sun wakes me
I'm stretchin' and yawnin'
In a bed that don't belong to me
And a voice yells "Good mornin', darlin', from the bathroom Then she comes out
and kisses me And to my surprise, she ain't you
Now I've got this dumb look on my face Like, what have I done? How could I be
so stupid To be have laid here til' the mornin' sun?
Must of lost the track of time Oh, what was on my mind? From the club, went to
her home Didn't plan to stay that long
Here I am, quickly tryin' to put on my clothes Searchin' for my car keys,
tryin' to get on up out the door Then she stretched her hands in front of it
Said, "You can't go this way"
Looked at her, like she was crazy Said, "Woman move out my way", said, "I got a
wife at home" She said, "Please don't go out there", "Lady, I've got to get
home" She said, "Her husband was comin' up the stairs "
"Shh, shh, quiet, hurry up and get in the closet" She said, "Don't you make a
sound Or some shit is goin' down" I said, "Why don't I just go out the window?"

"Yes, except for one thing, we on the 5th floor" "Shit think, shit think, shit
quick, put me in the closet" And now I'm in this dark ass closet, tryin' to
figure out Just how I'm gonna get my crazy ass up out this house
Then he walks in and yells, "I'm home" She says, "Honey, I'm in the room" He
walks in there with a smile on his face Sayin', "Honey, I've been missing you"
She hops all over him And says, "I've cooked and ran your bath water" I'm
tellin' you now This girl's so good that she deserves an Oscar
Throws her in the bed and start to snatchin' her clothes off I'm in the closet,
like man, what the fuck is goin' on? You're not gonna believe it But things get
deeper as the story goes on
Next thing you know A call comes through on my cell phone I tried my best to
quickly put it on vibrate But from the way he act, I could tell it was too late

He hopped up and said, "There's a mystery goin' on And I'm gonna solve it" And
I'm like "God please, don't let this man open this closet"
He walks in the bathroom And looks behind the door She says, "Baby, come back
to bed" He says, "Bitch, say no more"
He pulls back the shower curtain While she's bitin' her nails Then he walks
back to the room Right now, I'm sweatin' like hell
Checks under the bed then under the dresser He looks at the closet, I pull out
my Baretta He walks up to the closet, he comes up to the closet Now he's at the
closet, now he's openin' the closet


Well, now he's staring at me like
As if he was starin' in a mirror
She yells, "Honey let me explain"
He says, "You don't have to go no further"
"I can clearly see what's goin' on Behind my back In my bed, in my home" Then I
said, "Wait a minute now hold on"
I said, "Mister we can work this out" She said, "Honey don't lose control"
Tried to get him to calm down He said, "Oh, I should've known"
"That you would go and do Some bogus shit up in my house But the Christian in
me gave You the benefit of the doubt"
I said, "We need to resolve this" Then he stepped to me, I'm like, "Whoa
There's a reason I'm in this closet" He says, "Yeah, like what are you talkin'
clothes?"
 club And she told me she didn't have
a man Then he said, "Man please, I'd kill you If you didn't have that gun in ya
hand"
And then I said, "But your chick chose me" He said, "Don't give me that mack
shit, please" His phone goes off and then things Get a little more interesting
He steps a little closer I point my gun and say, "I'm not the one you after" He
says, "Somethin' I bet you didn't know my man Did she tell you that I was a
pastor?"
I said, "Well, good that's betta right Why can't we handle this Christian like"
And I started to put the gun down 'Til I saw his face still had a frown
She started cryin' Sayin', "Baby I'm sorry" Then he said, "Baby, not as sorry
As you're gonna be"
And I started inchin' out He says, "No I want you to see this" Said, "I gotta
get out this house" He said "Not 'til I reveal my secret"
I'm like what is goin' on inside his head Then he takes his phone and calls
somebody up and says "Hello, baby, turn the car around Listen, I just need for
you to get right back here now"
Click, he looks at me and says "Well, since we're all comin' out the closet I'm
not about to be The only one that's broken hearted"
She said, "What do you mean?" And he said, "Just wait and see" I said,
"Somebody betta talk to me" And then his phone rang
He picks up and somebody says "Sweetheart, I'm downstairs" And he's like, "I'll
buzz you up I'm on the fifth floor, hurry take the stairs"
And I'm like, "Who is this mystery lady That you're talking to?" He says, "In
time you both Will know the shockin' truth"
"Baby, this is something I been wanting To get off my chest for a long, long
time" Then I said, "Now I'mma shoot you both If you don't say what's on ya
mind"
He said, "Wait I hear somebody comin' up the stairs" And I'm lookin' at the
door He says, "I think you betta sit down in the chair" I says, "I'm gonna
count to four"
One, he says, "Mister wait" Two, she says, "Please don't shoot" Three, he says,
"Don't shoot me" Four, she screams
Then a knock on the door The guns in my hands He opens the door I can't believe
it's a man


Here we are, the four of us
In total shock, me and her
I closed my mouth and swallowed spit
And I'm thinking to myself, "This is some deep shit"
And I said, "So you're gonna tell me He's the one he's been talking to?" He
says, "Yes", I say, "No", he says, "Yes" I say, "No", he says, "It's the truth"

I said, "All of y'all ass is crazy, let me up out this door Because this is way
more than I bargained for" She says, "Wait, I'm sure we can all fix this" Then
I said, "I'm late, plus I ain't gotta damn thing to do with this"
But then she said, "Wouldn't you just like to know how it all began?" Then I
thought to myself and said, Quick, you got three minutes Then it got real
quiet, I said, "Somebody start talking" She said, "My God, Rufus, I've got just
one question
How could you do something like this? I'm so hurt" He looked at her and said,
"Bitch, please, you've got your nerves With all your club hopping, lying when
you said you was shopping And now here you are in our home and you're calling
me wrong"
She said, "Okay, you busted me and that much I agree You caught me cheating but
this is a little extreme" He said, "You are my wife, sleeping behind my back
And now I come home and you got him in the closet How extreme is that?"
And she said, "But she's a he" And he said, "Please, you can't judge me" She
said, "But Rufus this is crazy" And I said, "Stop arguing I did not stay here
to hear you chew each other out So get to the point or I swear I'm out"
"Excuse me, please but I think I can explain What's going on in here My name is
Chuck and I been knowing Rufus about a year At midnight creeping around with
him has been a living hell Sneaking in and out of hotels" I said, "Brother,
spare the details"
Then Rufus said, "Chuck, please, don't say nothing else" Then she screams,
"Rufus, you son of a bitch" He says, "Cathy, go to hell" I said, "I thought you
said your name was Mary That what you said at the party Man, this is getting
scary, I'ma shoot somebody"
Then Rufus start yelling and screaming saying "Cathy, this is all your fault"
She throws a pillow at him and says, "You were creeping too The only difference
is you didn't get caught" Chuck screamed out, "We're in love" Cathy says,
"Love, my ass" Rufus said they're getting married then I shoot one in the air
I said, "Not another one of you sons of bitches say a word 'Cuz all this shit
I'm going through is unheard" I grabbed my cellular, I said, "This is so
wrong", I call up my home And a man picks up the phone, phone, phone, phone


Now I'm dashin' home, doin' 85
Swervin' lane to lane with fire in my eyes
I got a million thoughts going through my mind
I'm thinkin' about what I'ma do
And who I'm gonna do it to when I get home
How could I have been so blind And then I look in my rear view I cannot believe
this, whoo, whoo, whoo Damn, here comes a police man
He drove right up on me and flashed his light Then I pulled over without
thinkin' twice He hopped out the car and walked over to me And said license and
registration please
I looked up at him and said Officer, is there somethin' wrong He said, "No,
except you were doin' 60 in a 40 mile zone" Then I said, "Officer let me
explain please
You see the truth of the matter is Is that I have an emergency" He said, "No
excuses and no exception" He lit his cigarette as he gave me the ticket
Said, "Have a nice day", and walked away I said, "Yeah right", and drove away
Then I turned my radio on And did 55 all the way home
I pulled up in the driveway Hopped out and slammed the car door Then go in
through the back Bust up in the house and she screamin'
What's all that for then I'm like woman I called this house And a man picked up
my phone Then she said, "Calm down, did you forget My brother Twan came home"
Oh, and that's all I could say was. oh With a stupid look on my face Said, "I
forgot he came home today" And she said, "That's okay
Because honey I understand" She said, "You don't have to explain" Then I took
her by the hand I kissed her and then we went to the room
Then I turned some music on Apologized one more time Then went down and start
gettin' it on And she started bitin' her lip
Grabbing me and makin' noise Now we makin' love and she's my ear whisperin'
"It's all yours", I said, "I love you" And she said, "I love you, too"
Then a tear fell up out my eye Then I called her my sunshine And then she
looked at me And said, "Baby go deeper please"
And that's when I start goin' crazy Like I was tryin' to give her a baby The
room feel like its spinnin' We keep turnin' and turnin'
As if we were in a whirlwind The way our toes are curlin' The next thing you
know, she starts goin' real wild And starts screamin' my name
Then I said, "Baby, we must slow down Before I bust a vessel in my brain" And
she said, "Please no, don't stop" And I said, "I caught a cramp"
And she said, "Please keep on goin'" I said, "My leg is about to crack" Then
she cries out "Oh my goodness, I'm about to climax"
And I said, Cool, climax just let go of my leg She says, "You're the perfect
lover" I said, "I can't go no further", then I flip back the cover Oh my God, a
rubber, rubber, rubber, rubber


Well, well, well, what the fuck is this?
A condom in my bed, you better start talkin' bitch
Before I take a match and burn this mother fucker down
I said, "You better start talkin' and start talkin' right goddamn now"
Then she said "Baby, I'm so speechless Then I said, "My baby you gon' be
breathless If you don't start talkin' quick! Woman I'm gon' have a fit!"
"You don't know what you fuckin' with Girl you better cut the bullshit!" Now
it's obvious somebody has been all up in my home, in my bed Plus I smell
cigarettes
Now I'm sniffin' and lookin' around, I'm suspicious like someone's here Then I
look in her eyes and in her eyes was so much fear Pull out my gun and said is
he still here She shook her head and said, "No"
I'm checkin' behind every door She cried out, "He left right after you called I
said, "What the fuck was you thinkin' You thought that I wouldn't find this
out"
Then I said, "You must be crazy You on crack to have someone all up in my
motherfuckin' house" She hopped up and said, "That's enough" She said, "I can't
take no more"
And the she said, "You made your point But now it's time to even the score" She
said, "I know all about last night" And where you went when you left the club"
She said, "That's right nigga I was there With this guy in the back of the
club" I said, "I thought you was with your girls" She said, "I thought you was
with your guys"
She said, "You was at that bitches house And don't you even try to act
surprised" I said, "Babe", she said, "Shut up don't you say a word It ain't
nothing you can say that I ain't already heard"
Then I said, "Woman don't you try to turn it all around" 'Cause the fact still
remains that someone else was in my house" Then she said, "Your right about
that, something did go down But I don't have to turn it around 'Cause what goes
around comes back around"
I'm movin' a little closer to her, she's trippin' over the furniture She said,
"Wait first just let me explain" I said, "No need to just give me his name" And
the she says, "Ah, ah", I say, "Ah what?"
She says, "Please sit down in the chair" And I say, "No I'm standing up" And
then she cries out, "I'm so scared to tell you Because of what you might do"
And I scream, "Look girl you better give me this mans name And I'm not playin'
with you!" She says, Okay Wipes her nose and asks me about a girl name Tina
I thought to myself, said, "It sounds familiar" Then said, "I'll probably know
her if I seen her" Then I said, "Anyway girl What the hell does that got to do
with this man?"
She said, "He know my girl Roxanne" I said, "Who the hell is Roxanne?" Then she
said, "Roxanne is a friend of mine Who know this guy named Chuck
Chucks cool with this guy named Rufus" And I'm sitting there like what the
fuck Then she says, "Rufus wife Cathy, we both went to high school She
introduce me to that policeman that stopped you"


Seven o'clock in the evening
Watchin somethin' stupid on TV
I'm zoned out on the sofa
When my wife comes in the room and sees me
And she says, Is this 'Behind the Music' With Lynyrd Skynyrd?" And I say, "I
don't know, say, it's gettin' late What cha wanna do for dinner?
She says, "I kinda had a big lunch So I'm not super hungry" I said, "Well you
know, baby I'm not starvin' either but I could eat"
She said, "So what do you have in mind?" I said, "I don't know, what about
you?" She says, "I don't care, if you're hungry let's eat" I said, "That's what
we're gonna do!"
"But first you gotta tell me What it is you're hungry for!" And she says, "Let
me think What's left in our refrigerator?"
I said, "Well, there's tuna, I know" She said, "That went bad a week ago!" I
said, "Is the chili okay?" She said, "You finished that yesterday!"
I hopped up and I said, "I don't know Do you want to get something delivered?"
She's like, "Why would I want to eat liver? I don't even like liver!"
I'm like, "No, I said 'delivered' " She's like, "I heard you say liver!" I'm
like, "I should know what I said" She's like, "Whatever, I just don't want any
liver!"
Well, I was gonna say something But my cell phone started to ring Now who could
be callin' me? Well I checked my caller ID
It was just cousin Larry callin' For the third time today My wife said, "Let it
go to voicemail" I said, "Okay"
"Where were we? Oh, dinner, right So what do you wanna do?" She said, "Why
don't you whip up somethin in the kitchen?" "Yeah?" I said, "Why don't you?"
And then she says "Baby, can't we just go out to dinner, please?" I says no,
she says yes, I says no, she says yes I says no, she says yes, oh, here's your
keys"
I step a little bit closer Say, "Okay, where ya wanna go?" She says, "How about
The Ivy?" I said, "Yeah, well I don't know"
I don't feel like, gettin all dressed up And eatin' expensive food She's
says, "Olive Garden?" I say, "Nah, I'm not in the mood
And Burrito King would make me gassy There's no doubt" She says, "Just forget
about it" I said, "No, I swear I'm gonna take you out!"
Then I get an idea I say, "I know what we'll do!" She says, "What?" I say,
"Guess" She says, "What?" I say, "We're goin' to the drive-thru!"
So we head out the front door Open the garage door Then I open the car doors
And we get in those car doors
Put my key in the ignition And then I turn it sideways Then we fasten our seat
belts As we pull out the driveway
Then we drive to the drive-thru Heading off to the drive-thru We're approaching
the drive-thru Getting close to the drive-thru
Almost there at the drive-thru Now we're here at the drive thru Here in line at
the drive-thru Did I mention the drive-thru?
Well, here we are in the drive-thru line Me and her Cars in front of us, cars
in back of us All just waiting to order
There's some idiot in a Volvo With his brights on behind me I lean out the
window and scream "Hey, what cha tryin to do, blind me?"
My wife says, "Maybe we should park We could just go eat inside" I said, "I'm
wearin' bunny slippers So I ain't leavin' this ride"
Now a woman on a speaker box Is sayin', "Can I take your order, please?" I
said, "Yes indeed, you certainly can We'd like two hamburgers with onions and
cheese"
Then my wife says "Baby, hold on, I've changed my mind! I think I'm gonna have
a chicken sandwich Instead this time"
I said, "You always get a cheeseburger!" She says, "That's not what I'm hungry
for" I put my head in my hands and scream "I don't know who you are anymore!"
The voice on the speaker says "I don't have all day!" I said, "Then take our
order And we'll be on our way!
"I wanna get a chicken sandwich And I want a cheeseburger too" She's like, "You
want onions on that?" I'm like, "Yeah, I already said that I do
Plus we need curly fries And don't you dare forget it And two medium root
beers No, just one, we'll split it"
Then I said, "I'm guessin' that You're probably not too bright So read me back
my order Let's make sure you got it right"
She says, "One, you want a chicken sandwich Two, you want a cheeseburger Three,
curly fries and a large root beer" "Stop, don't go no further!"
"I never ordered a large root beer I said medium, not large!" Then she says,
"We're havin' a special I super-sized you at no charge"
"Oh" And that's all I could say was "oh" And she says, "Now theres somethin'
else That I really think you should know
You can have unlimited refills For just a quarter more" I say, "Great, except
we're in the drive-thru So what would I want that for?"
Then she says, "Wait a minute Your voice sounds so familiar, hey, is this Paul?
And my wife is all like, "No, that ain't Paul Now tell me, who's this Paul?
She says, "Oh, he's just some guy Who goes to school with me I sat behind him
last year And I copied off of him in Geometry
I said, "I know a guy named Paul He used to be my plumber He was prematurely
bald And he moved to Pittsburgh last summer
He also had bladder problems And a really bad infection on his toe" And she
says, "Mister, please, you can stop right there That's way more than I needed
to know!"
And then we both were quiet And things got real intense And then she says,
"Next window please, That'll be five dollars and eighty two cents"
So we inched ahead in line Movin' painfully slow I got a little bored So I
turned on the radio
Click, turned it off Because my wife was getting a headache So we both just sat
there quietly For her sake
Then I looked at her And she looked back at me And I said, "Um I think you have
somethin' in your teeth"
She turned away from me And then turned back and said, "Did I get it?" I said,
"Yeah, well, I mean, most of it But hey, ya know, don't sweat it"
Then she said, "How about now?" I said, "Yeah, almost There's still a little
bit there but don't worry It's probably just a piece of toast"
Now we're at the pay window Or whatever you call it Put my hand in my pocket I
can't believe there's no wallet!
And the lady at the window's like "Well well well, that'll be five eighty-two"
I turn around to my wife and say "How much have you got on you?"
She just rolls her eyes and says "I'll pay for this I guess" So she reaches
into her purse And busts out the American Express
I hand it to the lady And she says, "Oh dear It's gotta be cash only We don't
take credit cards here"
I took back the card and said "Gee, really? Well that sucks!" And that's when I
found out My wife was only carryin' three bucks
I said, "I thought you were Going to hit the ATM today" She says, "I never got
around to it So where's your wallet anyway?
And I said, "Nevermind Just help me to find some change" Now the lady at the
window Is looking at me kinda strange
And she says, "Mister, please We gotta move this line along" I said, "Now hold
your stinkin' horses lady We won't be long"
So I looked around inside the glove box And checked the mat beneath my feet I
found a nickel in an ashtray And a couple pennies and a dime in the space
between the seats
Before long I had a little pile Of coins of every sort The lady counts it up
and says "You're still about a dollar short"
And now my woman's got this weird look Frozen on her face She screams, "You
know I wasn't even really hungry in the first place"
And so I turned around To the cashier again I shrugged and said, "Okay Forget
the chicken sandwich then"
So I pick up my change Pick up my receipt And I drive to the pickup window Man,
I just can't wait to eat
And now we see this acne ridden Kid about sixteen Wearin' a dorky nametag that
says "Hello, my name is Eugene"
And he hands me a paper bag I look him in the eyes And I say to him "Hey,
Eugene Could I get some ketchup for my fries?"
Well he looks at me And I look at him And he looks at me And I look at him
And he looks at me And I look at him And he says, "I'm sorry What did you want
again?"
I say, "Ketchup!" And he says, "Oh yeah, that's right I just spaced out there
for a second I'm really kind of burnt tonight"
And then he hands me the ketchup And then we're finally drivin' away And the
food is drivin' me mad With its intoxicating bouquet
I'm starvin' to death By the time we pull up at the traffic light I say, "Baby,
gimme that burger I just gotta have a bite!"
So she reaches in the bag And pulls out the burger And she hands me the burger
And I pick up the burger
And then I unwrap the paper I bite into those buns And I just can't believe it
They forgot the onions!


There's total silence, blood everywhere
And confusion on their faces as they continue to stare
Then Gwen starts shakin' and cryin', screamin', "What did you do?!"
And then the policeman looks at me and screams
"See, now I warned you!"
Then he starts pacing the floor screamin' "God, what have we done here?!" And
she rushed to the door, blood on her hands screamin' "There goes your whole
career"
Meanwhile, I'm freakin' out sayin', "We gotta do somethin' And gotta do
somethin' quick" Then he picks up the gun and says, "I have a wife at home I
can't have no cause of this" She says, "James, I can't believe you just said
what you said 'Cause that's not what you was sayin' when your ass was in my
bed"
Then I said, "Get married later, but right now we gotta use our heads First of
all, did anybody think to check if the man was alive or dead?" Then he looks at
her, she looks at me I look at them and we look at him Meanwhile, Gwen's about
to have a nervous breakdown The way she's shakin' and cryin'
And then she screams, "You bastards! You've killed my brother!" And then I
said, "Gwen, wait a minute, I didn't" She says, "No, you killed my brother!"
She said, "He just got out of prison, he's been through a lot He was talking
about changin' his life and everything And to come home and get shot"
And I said, "Baby, it wasn't my fault, this man had a gun on me And besides,
how was I to know that you was getting down With this crooked ass policeman?"
And he says, "Wait a minute," I say, "No, you wait a minute!" And then I say,
"Man, this is my wife We had a life until you butted up in it!"
She cried out, "Sylvester, now hold on! Even though he was in our home Let's
not forget the fact that you was out there Creepin' in another man's home"
Twan starts coughin' And she says, "Twan! Oh my god! Baby brother, are you
okay?" He looks up at her and says, "I'm not gonna die, at least not today" And
then he asks what happened, and says, "Why did I get shot? Sylvester what is
this policeman doin' here?" And I said, "Go on, tell him cop"
He says, "Son, we gotta get you to a hospital And take a look at that wound"
Twan says, "No, I'm okay, it's just my shoulder All I need is a bathroom" Now
five minutes has gone by and they tellin' Twan everything that happened Twan
says, "Fuck man, I would've been better off in prison"
And now somebody's banging at the door and I'm like "Aw no! Here we go again!"
Thinkin' out loud to myself, sayin', "When is this shit gonna end?!" Then
Gwendolyn looks at me and says, "Baby, you got that?" And I say, "No!" She
says, "Why?" And I said, "Because I'm not Openin' up another motherfuckin'
door!"
And the cop says, "Gwen, I'll get it" Then looks at me and says, "Man of the
house, my ass!" Then I say, "I'll get it, but whoever it is I'm about to put
their ass on blast!"
And then the policeman grabbed me I snatched away and got my gun up off the
floor Then Twan says, "Man, that's what I'm talkin' about! Sylvester, point
that shit toward the door!"
Then he snatches the policeman's gun and says "Officer, arrest me later" I
count to three, Twan opened the door and it's Rosy the nosy neighbor
Ooh, with a spatula in her hand Like that's gon' do something against them guns
It's Rosy the nosy neighbor


There's total silence, blood everywhere
And confusion on their faces as they continue to stare
Then Gwen starts shakin' and cryin', screamin', "What did you do?!"
And then the policeman looks at me and screams
"See, now I warned you!"
Then he starts pacing the floor screamin' "God, what have we done here?!" And
she rushed to the door, blood on her hands screamin' "There goes your whole
career"
Meanwhile, I'm freakin' out sayin', "We gotta do somethin' And gotta do
somethin' quick" Then he picks up the gun and says, "I have a wife at home I
can't have no cause of this" She says, "James, I can't believe you just said
what you said 'Cause that's not what you was sayin' when your ass was in my
bed"
Then I said, "Get married later, but right now we gotta use our heads First of
all, did anybody think to check if the man was alive or dead?" Then he looks at
her, she looks at me I look at them and we look at him Meanwhile, Gwen's about
to have a nervous breakdown The way she's shakin' and cryin'
And then she screams, "You bastards! You've killed my brother!" And then I
said, "Gwen, wait a minute, I didn't" She says, "No, you killed my brother!"
She said, "He just got out of prison, he's been through a lot He was talking
about changin' his life and everything And to come home and get shot"
And I said, "Baby, it wasn't my fault, this man had a gun on me And besides,
how was I to know that you was getting down With this crooked ass policeman?"
And he says, "Wait a minute," I say, "No, you wait a minute!" And then I say,
"Man, this is my wife We had a life until you butted up in it!"
She cried out, "Sylvester, now hold on! Even though he was in our home Let's
not forget the fact that you was out there Creepin' in another man's home"
Twan starts coughin' And she says, "Twan! Oh my god! Baby brother, are you
okay?" He looks up at her and says, "I'm not gonna die, at least not today" And
then he asks what happened, and says, "Why did I get shot? Sylvester what is
this policeman doin' here?" And I said, "Go on, tell him cop"

Twan says, "No, I'm okay, it's just my shoulder All I need is a bathroom" Now
five minutes has gone by and they tellin' Twan everything that happened Twan
says, "Fuck man, I would've been better off in prison"
And now somebody's banging at the door and I'm like "Aw no! Here we go again!"
Thinkin' out loud to myself, sayin', "When is this shit gonna end?!" Then
Gwendolyn looks at me and says, "Baby, you got that?" And I say, "No!" She

Seven o'clock in the evening
Watchin somethin' stupid on TV
I'm zoned out on the sofa
When my wife comes in the room and sees me
And she says, Is this 'Behind the Music' With Lynyrd Skynyrd?" And I say, "I
don't know, say, it's gettin' late What cha wanna do for dinner?
She says, "I kinda had a big lunch So I'm not super hungry" I said, "Well you
know, baby I'm not starvin' either but I could eat"
She said, "So what do you have in mind?" I said, "I don't know, what about
you?" She says, "I don't care, if you're hungry let's eat" I said, "That's what
we're gonna do!"
"But first you gotta tell me What it is you're hungry for!" And she says, "Let
me think What's left in our refrigerator?"
I said, "Well, there's tuna, I know" She said, "That went bad a week ago!" I
said, "Is the chili okay?" She said, "You finished that yesterday!"
I hopped up and I said, "I don't know Do you want to get something delivered?"
She's like, "Why would I want to eat liver? I don't even like liver!"
I'm like, "No, I said 'delivered' " She's like, "I heard you say liver!" I'm
like, "I should know what I said" She's like, "Whatever, I just don't want any
liver!"
Well, I was gonna say something But my cell phone started to ring Now who could
be callin' me? Well I checked my caller ID
It was just cousin Larry callin' For the third time today My wife said, "Let it
go to voicemail" I said, "Okay"
"Where were we? Oh, dinner, right So what do you wanna do?" She said, "Why
don't you whip up somethin in the kitchen?" "Yeah?" I said, "Why don't you?"
And then she says "Baby, can't we just go out to dinner, please?" I says no,
she says yes, I says no, she says yes I says no, she says yes, oh, here's your
keys"
I step a little bit closer Say, "Okay, where ya wanna go?" She says, "How about
The Ivy?" I said, "Yeah, well I don't know"
I don't feel like, gettin all dressed up And eatin' expensive food She's
says, "Olive Garden?" I say, "Nah, I'm not in the mood
And Burrito King would make me gassy There's no doubt" She says, "Just forget
about it" I said, "No, I swear I'm gonna take you out!"
Then I get an idea I say, "I know what we'll do!" She says, "What?" I say,
"Guess" She says, "What?" I say, "We're goin' to the drive-thru!"
So we head out the front door Open the garage door Then I open the car doors
And we get in those car doors
Put my key in the ignition And then I turn it sideways Then we fasten our seat
belts As we pull out the driveway
Then we drive to the drive-thru Heading off to the drive-thru We're approaching
the drive-thru Getting close to the drive-thru
Almost there at the drive-thru Now we're here at the drive thru Here in line at
the drive-thru Did I mention the drive-thru?
Well, here we are in the drive-thru line Me and her Cars in front of us, cars
in back of us All just waiting to order
There's some idiot in a Volvo With his brights on behind me I lean out the
window and scream "Hey, what cha tryin to do, blind me?"
My wife says, "Maybe we should park We could just go eat inside" I said, "I'm
wearin' bunny slippers So I ain't leavin' this ride"
Now a woman on a speaker box Is sayin', "Can I take your order, please?" I
said, "Yes indeed, you certainly can We'd like two hamburgers with onions and
cheese"
Then my wife says "Baby, hold on, I've changed my mind! I think I'm gonna have
a chicken sandwich Instead this time"
I said, "You always get a cheeseburger!" She says, "That's not what I'm hungry
for" I put my head in my hands and scream "I don't know who you are anymore!"
The voice on the speaker says "I don't have all day!" I said, "Then take our
order And we'll be on our way!
"I wanna get a chicken sandwich And I want a cheeseburger too" She's like, "You
want onions on that?" I'm like, "Yeah, I already said that I do
Plus we need curly fries And don't you dare forget it And two medium root
beers No, just one, we'll split it"
Then I said, "I'm guessin' that You're probably not too bright So read me back
my order Let's make sure you got it right"
She says, "One, you want a chicken sandwich Two, you want a cheeseburger Three,
curly fries and a large root beer" "Stop, don't go no further!"
"I never ordered a large root beer I said medium, not large!" Then she says,
"We're havin' a special I super-sized you at no charge"
"Oh" And that's all I could say was "oh" And she says, "Now theres somethin'
else That I really think you should know
You can have unlimited refills For just a quarter more" I say, "Great, except
we're in the drive-thru So what would I want that for?"
Then she says, "Wait a minute Your voice sounds so familiar, hey, is this Paul?
And my wife is all like, "No, that ain't Paul Now tell me, who's this Paul?
She says, "Oh, he's just some guy Who goes to school with me I sat behind him
last year And I copied off of him in Geometry
I said, "I know a guy named Paul He used to be my plumber He was prematurely
bald And he moved to Pittsburgh last summer
He also had bladder problems And a really bad infection on his toe" And she
says, "Mister, please, you can stop right there That's way more than I needed
to know!"
And then we both were quiet And things got real intense And then she says,
"Next window please, That'll be five dollars and eighty two cents"
So we inched ahead in line Movin' painfully slow I got a little bored So I
turned on the radio
Click, turned it off Because my wife was getting a headache So we both just sat
there quietly For her sake
Then I looked at her And she looked back at me And I said, "Um I think you have
somethin' in your teeth"
She turned away from me And then turned back and said, "Did I get it?" I said,
"Yeah, well, I mean, most of it But hey, ya know, don't sweat it"
Then she said, "How about now?" I said, "Yeah, almost There's still a little
bit there but don't worry It's probably just a piece of toast"
Now we're at the pay window Or whatever you call it Put my hand in my pocket I
can't believe there's no wallet!
And the lady at the window's like "Well well well, that'll be five eighty-two"
I turn around to my wife and say "How much have you got on you?"
She just rolls her eyes and says "I'll pay for this I guess" So she reaches
into her purse And busts out the American Express
I hand it to the lady And she says, "Oh dear It's gotta be cash only We don't
take credit cards here"
I took back the card and said "Gee, really? Well that sucks!" And that's when I
found out My wife was only carryin' three bucks
I said, "I thought you were Going to hit the ATM today" She says, "I never got
around to it So where's your wallet anyway?
And I said, "Nevermind Just help me to find some change" Now the lady at the
window Is looking at me kinda strange
And she says, "Mister, please We gotta move this line along" I said, "Now hold
your stinkin' horses lady We won't be long"
So I looked around inside the glove box And checked the mat beneath my feet I
found a nickel in an ashtray And a couple pennies and a dime in the space
between the seats
Before long I had a little pile Of coins of every sort The lady counts it up
and says "You're still about a dollar short"
And now my woman's got this weird look Frozen on her face She screams, "You
know I wasn't even really hungry in the first place"
And so I turned around To the cashier again I shrugged and said, "Okay Forget
the chicken sandwich then"
So I pick up my change Pick up my receipt And I drive to the pickup window Man,
I just can't wait to eat
And now we see this acne ridden Kid about sixteen Wearin' a dorky nametag that
says "Hello, my name is Eugene"
And he hands me a paper bag I look him in the eyes And I say to him "Hey,
Eugene Could I get some ketchup for my fries?"
Well he looks at me And I look at him And he looks at me And I look at him
And he looks at me And I look at him And he says, "I'm sorry What did you want
again?"
I say, "Ketchup!" And he says, "Oh yeah, that's right I just spaced out there
for a second I'm really kind of burnt tonight"
And then he hands me the ketchup And then we're finally drivin' away And the
food is drivin' me mad With its intoxicating bouquet
I'm starvin' to death By the time we pull up at the traffic light I say, "Baby,
gimme that burger I just gotta have a bite!"
So she reaches in the bag And pulls out the burger And she hands me the burger
And I pick up the burger
And then I unwrap the paper I bite into those buns And I just can't believe it
They forgot the onions!


There's total silence, blood everywhere
And confusion on their faces as they continue to stare
Then Gwen starts shakin' and cryin', screamin', "What did you do?!"
And then the policeman looks at me and screams
"See, now I warned you!"
Then he starts pacing the floor screamin' "God, what have we done here?!" And
she rushed to the door, blood on her hands screamin' "There goes your whole
career"
Meanwhile, I'm freakin' out sayin', "We gotta do somethin' And gotta do
somethin' quick" Then he picks up the gun and says, "I have a wife at home I
can't have no cause of this" She says, "James, I can't believe you just said
what you said 'Cause that's not what you was sayin' when your ass was in my

Then I said, "Get married later, but right now we gotta use our heads First of

her, she looks at me I look at them and we look at him Meanwhile, Gwen's about
to have a nervous breakdown The way she's shakin' and cryin'
And then she screams, "You bastards! You've killed my brother!" And then I
said, "Gwen, wait a minute, I didn't" She says, "No, you killed my brother!"
She said, "He just got out of prison, he's been through a lot He was talking
about changin' his life and everything And to come home and get shot"
And I said, "Baby, it wasn't my fault, this man had a gun on me And besides,
how was I to know that you was getting down With this crooked ass policeman?"
And he says, "Wait a minute," I say, "No, you wait a minute!" And then I say,
"Man, this is my wife We had a life until you butted up in it!"
She cried out, "Sylvester, now hold on! Even though he was in our home Let's
not forget the fact that you was out there Creepin' in another man's home"
Twan starts coughin' And she says, "Twan! Oh my god! Baby brother, are you
okay?" He looks up at her and says, "I'm not gonna die, at least not today" And
then he asks what happened, and says, "Why did I get shot? Sylvester what is
this policeman doin' here?" And I said, "Go on, tell him cop"
He says, "Son, we gotta get you to a hospital And take a look at that wound"
Twan says, "No, I'm okay, it's just my shoulder All I need is a bathroom" Now
five minutes has gone by and they tellin' Twan everything that happened Twan
says, "Fuck man, I would've been better off in prison"
And now somebody's banging at the door and I'm like "Aw no! Here we go again!"
Thinkin' out loud to myself, sayin', "When is this shit gonna end?!" Then
Gwendolyn looks at me and says, "Baby, you got that?" And I say, "No!" She
says, "Why?" And I said, "Because I'm not Openin' up another motherfuckin'

floor Then Twan says, "Man, that's what I'm talkin' about! Sylvester, point
that shit toward the door!"
Then he snatches the policeman's gun and says "Officer, arrest me later" I
count to three, Twan opened the door and it's Rosy the nosy neighbor
Ooh, with a spatula in her hand Like that's gon' do something against them guns

then he asks what happened, and says, "Why did I get shot? Sylvester what is
this policeman doin' here?" And I said, "Go on, tell him cop"
He says, "Son, we gotta get you to a hospital And take a look at that wound"
Twan says, "No, I'm okay, it's just my shoulder All I need is a bathroom" Now
five minutes has gone by and they tellin' Twan everything that happened Twan
says, "Fuck man, I would've been better off in prison"
And now somebody's banging at the door and I'm like "Aw no! Here we go again!"
Thinkin' out loud to myself, sayin', "When is this shit gonna end?!" Then
Gwendolyn looks at me and says, "Baby, you got that?" And I say, "No!" She
says, "Why?" And I said, "Because I'm not Openin' up another motherfuckin'
door!"
And the cop says, "Gwen, I'll get it" Then looks at me and says, "Man of the
house, my ass!" Then I say, "I'll get it, but whoever it is I'm about to put
their ass on blast!"
And then the policeman grabbed me I snatched away and got my gun up off the
floor Then Twan says, "Man, that's what I'm talkin' about! Sylvester, point
that shit toward the door!"
Then he snatches the policeman's gun and says "Officer, arrest me later" I
count to three, Twan opened the door and it's Rosy the nosy neighbor
Ooh, with a spatula in her hand Like that's gon' do something against them guns
It's Rosy the nosy neighbor


Seven o'clock in the evening
Watchin somethin' stupid on TV
I'm zoned out on the sofa
When my wife comes in the room and sees me
And she says, Is this 'Behind the Music' With Lynyrd Skynyrd?" And I say, "I
don't know, say, it's gettin' late What cha wanna do for dinner?
She says, "I kinda had a big lunch So I'm not super hungry" I said, "Well you
know, baby I'm not starvin' either but I could eat"
She said, "So what do you have in mind?" I said, "I don't know, what about
you?" She says, "I don't care, if you're hungry let's eat" I said, "That's what
we're gonna do!"
"But first you gotta tell me What it is you're hungry for!" And she says, "Let
me think What's left in our refrigerator?"
I said, "Well, there's tuna, I know" She said, "That went bad a week ago!" I
said, "Is the chili okay?" She said, "You finished that yesterday!"
I hopped up and I said, "I don't know Do you want to get something delivered?"
She's like, "Why would I want to eat liver? I don't even like liver!"
I'm like, "No, I said 'delivered' " She's like, "I heard you say liver!" I'm
like, "I should know what I said" She's like, "Whatever, I just don't want any
liver!"
Well, I was gonna say something But my cell phone started to ring Now who could
be callin' me? Well I checked my caller ID
It was just cousin Larry callin' For the third time today My wife said, "Let it
go to voicemail" I said, "Okay"
"Where were we? Oh, dinner, right So what do you wanna do?" She said, "Why
don't you whip up somethin in the kitchen?" "Yeah?" I said, "Why don't you?"
And then she says "Baby, can't we just go out to dinner, please?" I says no,
she says yes, I says no, she says yes I says no, she says yes, oh, here's your
keys"
I step a little bit closer Say, "Okay, where ya wanna go?" She says, "How about
The Ivy?" I said, "Yeah, well I don't know"
I don't feel like, gettin all dressed up And eatin' expensive food She's
says, "Olive Garden?" I say, "Nah, I'm not in the mood
And Burrito King would make me gassy There's no doubt" She says, "Just forget
about it" I said, "No, I swear I'm gonna take you out!"
Then I get an idea I say, "I know what we'll do!" She says, "What?" I say,
"Guess" She says, "What?" I say, "We're goin' to the drive-thru!"
So we head out the front door Open the garage door Then I open the car doors
And we get in those car doors
Put my key in the ignition And then I turn it sideways Then we fasten our seat
belts As we pull out the driveway
Then we drive to the drive-thru Heading off to the drive-thru We're approaching
the drive-thru Getting close to the drive-thru
Almost there at the drive-thru Now we're here at the drive thru Here in line at
the drive-thru Did I mention the drive-thru?
Well, here we are in the drive-thru line Me and her Cars in front of us, cars
in back of us All just waiting to order
There's some idiot in a Volvo With his brights on behind me I lean out the
window and scream "Hey, what cha tryin to do, blind me?"
My wife says, "Maybe we should park We could just go eat inside" I said, "I'm
wearin' bunny slippers So I ain't leavin' this ride"
Now a woman on a speaker box Is sayin', "Can I take your order, please?" I
said, "Yes indeed, you certainly can We'd like two hamburgers with onions and
cheese"
Then my wife says "Baby, hold on, I've changed my mind! I think I'm gonna have
a chicken sandwich Instead this time"
I said, "You always get a cheeseburger!" She says, "That's not what I'm hungry
for" I put my head in my hands and scream "I don't know who you are anymore!"
The voice on the speaker says "I don't have all day!" I said, "Then take our
order And we'll be on our way!
"I wanna get a chicken sandwich And I want a cheeseburger too" She's like, "You
want onions on that?" I'm like, "Yeah, I already said that I do
Plus we need curly fries And don't you dare forget it And two medium root
beers No, just one, we'll split it"
Then I said, "I'm guessin' that You're probably not too bright So read me back
my order Let's make sure you got it right"
She says, "One, you want a chicken sandwich Two, you want a cheeseburger Three,
curly fries and a large root beer" "Stop, don't go no further!"
"I never ordered a large root beer I said medium, not large!" Then she says,
"We're havin' a special I super-sized you at no charge"
"Oh" And that's all I could say was "oh" And she says, "Now theres somethin'
else That I really think you should know
You can have unlimited refills For just a quarter more" I say, "Great, except
we're in the drive-thru So what would I want that for?"
Then she says, "Wait a minute Your voice sounds so familiar, hey, is this Paul?
And my wife is all like, "No, that ain't Paul Now tell me, who's this Paul?
She says, "Oh, he's just some guy Who goes to school with me I sat behind him
last year And I copied off of him in Geometry
I said, "I know a guy named Paul He used to be my plumber He was prematurely
bald And he moved to Pittsburgh last summer
He also had bladder problems And a really bad infection on his toe" And she
says, "Mister, please, you can stop right there That's way more than I needed
to know!"
And then we both were quiet And things got real intense And then she says,
"Next window please, That'll be five dollars and eighty two cents"
So we inched ahead in line Movin' painfully slow I got a little bored So I
turned on the radio
Click, turned it off Because my wife was getting a headache So we both just sat
there quietly For her sake
Then I looked at her And she looked back at me And I said, "Um I think you have
somethin' in your teeth"
She turned away from me And then turned back and said, "Did I get it?" I said,
"Yeah, well, I mean, most of it But hey, ya know, don't sweat it"
Then she said, "How about now?" I said, "Yeah, almost There's still a little
bit there but don't worry It's probably just a piece of toast"
Now we're at the pay window Or whatever you call it Put my hand in my pocket I
can't believe there's no wallet!
And the lady at the window's like "Well well well, that'll be five eighty-two"
I turn around to my wife and say "How much have you got on you?"
She just rolls her eyes and says "I'll pay for this I guess" So she reaches
into her purse And busts out the American Express
I hand it to the lady And she says, "Oh dear It's gotta be cash only We don't
take credit cards here"
I took back the card and said "Gee, really? Well that sucks!" And that's when I
found out My wife was only carryin' three bucks
I said, "I thought you were Going to hit the ATM today" She says, "I never got
around to it So where's your wallet anyway?
And I said, "Nevermind Just help me to find some change" Now the lady at the
window Is looking at me kinda strange
And she says, "Mister, please We gotta move this line along" I said, "Now hold
your stinkin' horses lady We won't be long"
So I looked around inside the glove box And checked the mat beneath my feet I
found a nickel in an ashtray And a couple pennies and a dime in the space
between the seats
Before long I had a little pile Of coins of every sort The lady counts it up
and says "You're still about a dollar short"
And now my woman's got this weird look Frozen on her face She screams, "You
know I wasn't even really hungry in the first place"
And so I turned around To the cashier again I shrugged and said, "Okay Forget
the chicken sandwich then"
So I pick up my change Pick up my receipt And I drive to the pickup window Man,
I just can't wait to eat
And now we see this acne ridden Kid about sixteen Wearin' a dorky nametag that
says "Hello, my name is Eugene"
And he hands me a paper bag I look him in the eyes And I say to him "Hey,
Eugene Could I get some ketchup for my fries?"
Well he looks at me And I look at him And he looks at me And I look at him
And he looks at me And I look at him And he says, "I'm sorry What did you want
again?"
I say, "Ketchup!" And he says, "Oh yeah, that's right I just spaced out there
for a second I'm really kind of burnt tonight"
And then he hands me the ketchup And then we're finally drivin' away And the
food is drivin' me mad With its intoxicating bouquet
I'm starvin' to death By the time we pull up at the traffic light I say, "Baby,
gimme that burger I just gotta have a bite!"
So she reaches in the bag And pulls out the burger And she hands me the burger
And I pick up the burger
And then I unwrap the paper I bite into those buns And I just can't believe it
They forgot the onions!


There's total silence, blood everywhere
And confusion on their faces as they continue to stare
Then Gwen starts shakin' and cryin', screamin', "What did you do?!"
And then the policeman looks at me and screams
"See, now I warned you!"
Then he starts pacing the floor screamin' "God, what have we done here?!" And
she rushed to the door, blood on her hands screamin' "There goes your whole
career"
Meanwhile, I'm freakin' out sayin', "We gotta do somethin' And gotta do
somethin' quick" Then he picks up the gun and says, "I have a wife at home I
can't have no cause of this" She says, "James, I can't believe you just said
what you said 'Cause that's not what you was sayin' when your ass was in my
bed"
Then I said, "Get married later, but right now we gotta use our heads First of
all, did anybody think to check if the man was alive or dead?" Then he looks at
her, she looks at me I look at them and we look at him Meanwhile, Gwen's about
to have a nervous breakdown The way she's shakin' and cryin'
And then she screams, "You bastards! You've killed my brother!" And then I
said, "Gwen, wait a minute, I didn't" She says, "No, you killed my brother!"
She said, "He just got out of prison, he's been through a lot He was talking
about changin' his life and everything And to come home and get shot"
And I said, "Baby, it wasn't my fault, this man had a gun on me And besides,
how was I to know that you was getting down With this crooked ass policeman?"
And he says, "Wait a minute," I say, "No, you wait a minute!" And then I say,
"Man, this is my wife We had a life until you butted up in it!"
She cried out, "Sylvester, now hold on! Even though he was in our home Let's
not forget the fact that you was out there Creepin' in another man's home"
Twan starts coughin' And she says, "Twan! Oh my god! Baby brother, are you
okay?" He looks up at her and says, "I'm not gonna die, at least not today" And
then he asks what happened, and says, "Why did I get shot? Sylvester what is
this policeman doin' here?" And I said, "Go on, tell him cop"
He says, "Son, we gotta get you to a hospital And take a look at that wound"
Twan says, "No, I'm okay, it's just my shoulder All I need is a bathroom" Now
five minutes has gone by and they tellin' Twan everything that happened Twan
says, "Fuck man, I would've been better off in prison"
And now somebody's banging at the door and I'm like "Aw no! Here we go again!"
Thinkin' out loud to myself, sayin', "When is this shit gonna end?!" Then
Gwendolyn looks at me and says, "Baby, you got that?" And I say, "No!" She

I don't feel like, gettin all dressed up And eatin' expensive food She's
says, "Olive Garden?" I say, "Nah, I'm not in the mood
And Burrito King would make me gassy There's no doubt" She says, "Just forget
about it" I said, "No, I swear I'm gonna take you out!"
Then I get an idea I say, "I know what we'll do!" She says, "What?" I say,
"Guess" She says, "What?" I say, "We're goin' to the drive-thru!"
So we head out the front door Open the garage door Then I open the car doors
And we get in those car doors
Put my key in the ignition And then I turn it sideways Then we fasten our seat
belts As we pull out the driveway
Then we drive to the drive-thru Heading off to the drive-thru We're approaching
the drive-thru Getting close to the drive-thru
Almost there at the drive-thru Now we're here at the drive thru Here in line at
the drive-thru Did I mention the drive-thru?
Well, here we are in the drive-thru line Me and her Cars in front of us, cars
in back of us All just waiting to order
There's some idiot in a Volvo With his brights on behind me I lean out the
window and scream "Hey, what cha tryin to do, blind me?"
My wife says, "Maybe we should park We could just go eat inside" I said, "I'm
wearin' bunny slippers So I ain't leavin' this ride"
Now a woman on a speaker box Is sayin', "Can I take your order, please?" I
said, "Yes indeed, you certainly can We'd like two hamburgers with onions and
cheese"
Then my wife says "Baby, hold on, I've changed my mind! I think I'm gonna have
a chicken sandwich Instead this time"
I said, "You always get a cheeseburger!" She says, "That's not what I'm hungry
for" I put my head in my hands and scream "I don't know who you are anymore!"
The voice on the speaker says "I don't have all day!" I said, "Then take our
order And we'll be on our way!
"I wanna get a chicken sandwich And I want a cheeseburger too" She's like, "You
want onions on that?" I'm like, "Yeah, I already said that I do
Plus we need curly fries And don't you dare forget it And two medium root
beers No, just one, we'll split it"
Then I said, "I'm guessin' that You're probably not too bright So read me back
my order Let's make sure you got it right"
She says, "One, you want a chicken sandwich Two, you want a cheeseburger Three,
curly fries and a large root beer" "Stop, don't go no further!"
"I never ordered a large root beer I said medium, not large!" Then she says,
"We're havin' a special I super-sized you at no charge"
"Oh" And that's all I could say was "oh" And she says, "Now theres somethin'
else That I really think you should know
You can have unlimited refills For just a quarter more" I say, "Great, except
we're in the drive-thru So what would I want that for?"
Then she says, "Wait a minute Your voice sounds so familiar, hey, is this Paul?
And my wife is all like, "No, that ain't Paul Now tell me, who's this Paul?
She says, "Oh, he's just some guy Who goes to school with me I sat behind him
last year And I copied off of him in Geometry
I said, "I know a guy named Paul He used to be my plumber He was prematurely
bald And he moved to Pittsburgh last summer
He also had bladder problems And a really bad infection on his toe" And she
says, "Mister, please, you can stop right there That's way more than I needed
to know!"
And then we both were quiet And things got real intense And then she says,
"Next window please, That'll be five dollars and eighty two cents"
So we inched ahead in line Movin' painfully slow I got a little bored So I
turned on the radio
Click, turned it off Because my wife was getting a headache So we both just sat
there quietly For her sake
Then I looked at her And she looked back at me And I said, "Um I think you have
somethin' in your teeth"
She turned away from me And then turned back and said, "Did I get it?" I said,
"Yeah, well, I mean, most of it But hey, ya know, don't sweat it"
Then she said, "How about now?" I said, "Yeah, almost There's still a little
bit there but don't worry It's probably just a piece of toast"
Now we're at the pay window Or whatever you call it Put my hand in my pocket I
can't believe there's no wallet!
And the lady at the window's like "Well well well, that'll be five eighty-two"
I turn around to my wife and say "How much have you got on you?"
She just rolls her eyes and says "I'll pay for this I guess" So she reaches
into her purse And busts out the American Express
I hand it to the lady And she says, "Oh dear It's gotta be cash only We don't
take credit cards here"
I took back the card and said "Gee, really? Well that sucks!" And that's when I
found out My wife was only carryin' three bucks
I said, "I thought you were Going to hit the ATM today" She says, "I never got
around to it So where's your wallet anyway?
And I said, "Nevermind Just help me to find some change" Now the lady at the
window Is looking at me kinda strange
And she says, "Mister, please We gotta move this line along" I said, "Now hold
your stinkin' horses lady We won't be long"
So I looked around inside the glove box And checked the mat beneath my feet I
found a nickel in an ashtray And a couple pennies and a dime in the space
between the seats
Before long I had a little pile Of coins of every sort The lady counts it up
and says "You're still about a dollar short"
And now my woman's got this weird look Frozen on her face She screams, "You
know I wasn't even really hungry in the first place"
And so I turned around To the cashier again I shrugged and said, "Okay Forget
the chicken sandwich then"
So I pick up my change Pick up my receipt And I drive to the pickup window Man,
I just can't wait to eat
And now we see this acne ridden Kid about sixteen Wearin' a dorky nametag that
says "Hello, my name is Eugene"
And he hands me a paper bag I look him in the eyes And I say to him "Hey,
Eugene Could I get some ketchup for my fries?"
Well he looks at me And I look at him And he looks at me And I look at him
And he looks at me And I look at him And he says, "I'm sorry What did you want
again?"
I say, "Ketchup!" And he says, "Oh yeah, that's right I just spaced out there
for a second I'm really kind of burnt tonight"
And then he hands me the ketchup And then we're finally drivin' away And the
food is drivin' me mad With its intoxicating bouquet
I'm starvin' to death By the time we pull up at the traffic light I say, "Baby,
gimme that burger I just gotta have a bite!"
So she reaches in the bag And pulls out the burger And she hands me the burger
And I pick up the burger
And then I unwrap the paper I bite into those buns And I just can't believe it
They forgot the onions!


There's total silence, blood everywhere
And confusion on their faces as they continue to stare
Then Gwen starts shakin' and cryin', screamin', "What did you do?!"
And then the policeman looks at me and screams
"See, now I warned you!"
Then he starts pacing the floor screamin' "God, what have we done here?!" And
she rushed to the door, blood on her hands screamin' "There goes your whole
career"
Meanwhile, I'm freakin' out sayin', "We gotta do somethin' And gotta do
somethin' quick" Then he picks up the gun and says, "I have a wife at home I
can't have no cause of this" She says, "James, I can't believe you just said
what you said 'Cause that's not what you was sayin' when your ass was in my
bed"
Then I said, "Get married later, but right now we gotta use our heads First of
all, did anybody think to check if the man was alive or dead?" Then he looks at
her, she looks at me I look at them and we look at him Meanwhile, Gwen's about
to have a nervous breakdown The way she's shakin' and cryin'
And then she screams, "You bastards! You've killed my brother!" And then I
said, "Gwen, wait a minute, I didn't" She says, "No, you killed my brother!"
She said, "He just got out of prison, he's been through a lot He was talking
about changin' his life and everything And to come home and get shot"
And I said, "Baby, it wasn't my fault, this man had a gun on me And besides,
how was I to know that you was getting down With this crooked ass policeman?"
And he says, "Wait a minute," I say, "No, you wait a minute!" And then I say,
"Man, this is my wife We had a life until you butted up in it!"
She cried out, "Sylvester, now hold on! Even though he was in our home Let's
not forget the fact that you was out there Creepin' in another man's home"
Twan starts coughin' And she says, "Twan! Oh my god! Baby brother, are you
okay?" He looks up at her and says, "I'm not gonna die, at least not today" And
then he asks what happened, and says, "Why did I get shot? Sylvester what is
this policeman doin' here?" And I said, "Go on, tell him cop"
He says, "Son, we gotta get you to a hospital And take a look at that wound"
Twan says, "No, I'm okay, it's just my shoulder All I need is a bathroom" Now
five minutes has gone by and they tellin' Twan everything that happened Twan
says, "Fuck man, I would've been better off in prison"
And now somebody's banging at the door and I'm like "Aw no! Here we go again!"
Thinkin' out loud to myself, sayin', "When is this shit gonna end?!" Then
Gwendolyn looks at me and says, "Baby, you got that?" And I say, "No!" She
says, "Why?" And I said, "Because I'm not Openin' up another motherfuckin'
door!"
And the cop says, "Gwen, I'll get it" Then looks at me and says, "Man of the
house, my ass!" Then I say, "I'll get it, but whoever it is I'm about to put
their ass on blast!"
And then the policeman grabbed me I snatched away and got my gun up off the
floor Then Twan says, "Man, that's what I'm talkin' about! Sylvester, point
that shit toward the door!"
Then he snatches the policeman's gun and says "Officer, arrest me later" I
count to three, Twan opened the door and it's Rosy the nosy neighbor
Ooh, with a spatula in her hand Like that's gon' do something against them guns
It's Rosy the nosy neighbor


Seven o'clock in the evening
Watchin somethin' stupid on TV
I'm zoned out on the sofa
When my wife comes in the room and sees me
And she says, Is this 'Behind the Music' With Lynyrd Skynyrd?" And I say, "I
don't know, say, it's gettin' late What cha wanna do for dinner?
She says, "I kinda had a big lunch So I'm not super hungry" I said, "Well you
know, baby I'm not starvin' either but I could eat"
She said, "So what do you have in mind?" I said, "I don't know, what about
you?" She says, "I don't care, if you're hungry let's eat" I said, "That's what
we're gonna do!"
"But first you gotta tell me What it is you're hungry for!" And she says, "Let
me think What's left in our refrigerator?"
I said, "Well, there's tuna, I know" She said, "That went bad a week ago!" I
said, "Is the chili okay?" She said, "You finished that yesterday!"
I hopped up and I said, "I don't know Do you want to get something delivered?"
She's like, "Why would I want to eat liver? I don't even like liver!"
I'm like, "No, I said 'delivered' " She's like, "I heard you say liver!" I'm
like, "I should know what I said" She's like, "Whatever, I just don't want any
liver!"
Well, I was gonna say something But my cell phone started to ring Now who could
be callin' me? Well I checked my caller ID
It was just cousin Larry callin' For the third time today My wife said, "Let it
go to voicemail" I said, "Okay"
"Where were we? Oh, dinner, right So what do you wanna do?" She said, "Why
don't you whip up somethin in the kitchen?" "Yeah?" I said, "Why don't you?"
And then she says "Baby, can't we just go out to dinner, please?" I says no,
she says yes, I says no, she says yes I says no, she says yes, oh, here's your
keys"
I step a little bit closer Say, "Okay, where ya wanna go?" She says, "How about
The Ivy?" I said, "Yeah, well I don't know"
I don't feel like, gettin all dressed up And eatin' expensive food She's

says, "Fuck man, I would've been better off in prison"
And now somebody's banging at the door and I'm like "Aw no! Here we go again!"
Thinkin' out loud to myself, sayin', "When is this shit gonna end?!" Then
Gwendolyn looks at me and says, "Baby, you got that?" And I say, "No!" She
says, "Why?" And I said, "Because I'm not Openin' up another motherfuckin'
door!"
And the cop says, "Gwen, I'll get it" Then looks at me and says, "Man of the
house, my ass!" Then I say, "I'll get it, but whoever it is I'm about to put
their ass on blast!"
And then the policeman grabbed me I snatched away and got my gun up off the
floor Then Twan says, "Man, that's what I'm talkin' about! Sylvester, point
that shit toward the door!"
Then he snatches the policeman's gun and says "Officer, arrest me later" I
count to three, Twan opened the door and it's Rosy the nosy neighbor
Ooh, with a spatula in her hand Like that's gon' do something against them guns
It's Rosy the nosy neighbor


There's total silence, blood everywhere
And confusion on their faces as they continue to stare
Then Gwen starts shakin' and cryin', screamin', "What did you do?!"
And then the policeman looks at me and screams
"See, now I warned you!"
Then he starts pacing the floor screamin' "God, what have we done here?!" And
she rushed to the door, blood on her hands screamin' "There goes your whole
career"
Meanwhile, I'm freakin' out sayin', "We gotta do somethin' And gotta do
somethin' quick" Then he picks up the gun and says, "I have a wife at home I
can't have no cause of this" She says, "James, I can't believe you just said
what you said 'Cause that's not what you was sayin' when your ass was in my
bed"
Then I said, "Get married later, but right now we gotta use our heads First of
all, did anybody think to check if the man was alive or dead?" Then he looks at
her, she looks at me I look at them and we look at him Meanwhile, Gwen's about
to have a nervous breakdown The way she's shakin' and cryin'
And then she screams, "You bastards! You've killed my brother!" And then I
said, "Gwen, wait a minute, I didn't" She says, "No, you killed my brother!"
She said, "He just got out of prison, he's been through a lot He was talking
about changin' his life and everything And to come home and get shot"
And I said, "Baby, it wasn't my fault, this man had a gun on me And besides,
how was I to know that you was getting down With this crooked ass policeman?"
And he says, "Wait a minute," I say, "No, you wait a minute!" And then I say,
"Man, this is my wife We had a life until you butted up in it!"
She cried out, "Sylvester, now hold on! Even though he was in our home Let's
not forget the fact that you was out there Creepin' in another man's home"
Twan starts coughin' And she says, "Twan! Oh my god! Baby brother, are you
okay?" He looks up at her and says, "I'm not gonna die, at least not today" And
then he asks what happened, and says, "Why did I get shot? Sylvester what is
this policeman doin' here?" And I said, "Go on, tell him cop"
He says, "Son, we gotta get you to a hospital And take a look at that wound"
Twan says, "No, I'm okay, it's just my shoulder All I need is a bathroom" Now
five minutes has gone by and they tellin' Twan everything that happened Twan
says, "Fuck man, I would've been better off in prison"
And now somebody's banging at the door and I'm like "Aw no! Here we go again!"

Seven o'clock in the evening
Watchin somethin' stupid on TV
I'm zoned out on the sofa
When my wife comes in the room and sees me
And she says, Is this 'Behind the Music' With Lynyrd Skynyrd?" And I say, "I
don't know, say, it's gettin' late What cha wanna do for dinner?
She says, "I kinda had a big lunch So I'm not super hungry" I said, "Well you
know, baby I'm not starvin' either but I could eat"
She said, "So what do you have in mind?" I said, "I don't know, what about
you?" She says, "I don't care, if you're hungry let's eat" I said, "That's what
we're gonna do!"
"But first you gotta tell me What it is you're hungry for!" And she says, "Let
me think What's left in our refrigerator?"
I said, "Well, there's tuna, I know" She said, "That went bad a week ago!" I
said, "Is the chili okay?" She said, "You finished that yesterday!"
I hopped up and I said, "I don't know Do you want to get something delivered?"
She's like, "Why would I want to eat liver? I don't even like liver!"
I'm like, "No, I said 'delivered' " She's like, "I heard you say liver!" I'm
like, "I should know what I said" She's like, "Whatever, I just don't want any
liver!"
Well, I was gonna say something But my cell phone started to ring Now who could
be callin' me? Well I checked my caller ID
It was just cousin Larry callin' For the third time today My wife said, "Let it
go to voicemail" I said, "Okay"
"Where were we? Oh, dinner, right So what do you wanna do?" She said, "Why
don't you whip up somethin in the kitchen?" "Yeah?" I said, "Why don't you?"
And then she says "Baby, can't we just go out to dinner, please?" I says no,
she says yes, I says no, she says yes I says no, she says yes, oh, here's your
keys"
I step a little bit closer Say, "Okay, where ya wanna go?" She says, "How about
The Ivy?" I said, "Yeah, well I don't know"
I don't feel like, gettin all dressed up And eatin' expensive food She's
says, "Olive Garden?" I say, "Nah, I'm not in the mood
And Burrito King would make me gassy There's no doubt" She says, "Just forget
about it" I said, "No, I swear I'm gonna take you out!"
Then I get an idea I say, "I know what we'll do!" She says, "What?" I say,
"Guess" She says, "What?" I say, "We're goin' to the drive-thru!"
So we head out the front door Open the garage door Then I open the car doors
And we get in those car doors
Put my key in the ignition And then I turn it sideways Then we fasten our seat
belts As we pull out the driveway
Then we drive to the drive-thru Heading off to the drive-thru We're approaching
the drive-thru Getting close to the drive-thru
Almost there at the drive-thru Now we're here at the drive thru Here in line at
the drive-thru Did I mention the drive-thru?
Well, here we are in the drive-thru line Me and her Cars in front of us, cars
in back of us All just waiting to order
There's some idiot in a Volvo With his brights on behind me I lean out the
window and scream "Hey, what cha tryin to do, blind me?"
My wife says, "Maybe we should park We could just go eat inside" I said, "I'm
wearin' bunny slippers So I ain't leavin' this ride"
Now a woman on a speaker box Is sayin', "Can I take your order, please?" I
said, "Yes indeed, you certainly can We'd like two hamburgers with onions and
cheese"
Then my wife says "Baby, hold on, I've changed my mind! I think I'm gonna have
a chicken sandwich Instead this time"
I said, "You always get a cheeseburger!" She says, "That's not what I'm hungry
for" I put my head in my hands and scream "I don't know who you are anymore!"
The voice on the speaker says "I don't have all day!" I said, "Then take our
order And we'll be on our way!
"I wanna get a chicken sandwich And I want a cheeseburger too" She's like, "You
want onions on that?" I'm like, "Yeah, I already said that I do
Plus we need curly fries And don't you dare forget it And two medium root
beers No, just one, we'll split it"
Then I said, "I'm guessin' that You're probably not too bright So read me back
my order Let's make sure you got it right"
She says, "One, you want a chicken sandwich Two, you want a cheeseburger Three,
curly fries and a large root beer" "Stop, don't go no further!"
"I never ordered a large root beer I said medium, not large!" Then she says,
"We're havin' a special I super-sized you at no charge"
"Oh" And that's all I could say was "oh" And she says, "Now theres somethin'
else That I really think you should know
You can have unlimited refills For just a quarter more" I say, "Great, except
we're in the drive-thru So what would I want that for?"
Then she says, "Wait a minute Your voice sounds so familiar, hey, is this Paul?
And my wife is all like, "No, that ain't Paul Now tell me, who's this Paul?
She says, "Oh, he's just some guy Who goes to school with me I sat behind him
last year And I copied off of him in Geometry
I said, "I know a guy named Paul He used to be my plumber He was prematurely
bald And he moved to Pittsburgh last summer
He also had bladder problems And a really bad infection on his toe" And she
says, "Mister, please, you can stop right there That's way more than I needed
to know!"
And then we both were quiet And things got real intense And then she says,
"Next window please, That'll be five dollars and eighty two cents"
So we inched ahead in line Movin' painfully slow I got a little bored So I
turned on the radio
Click, turned it off Because my wife was getting a headache So we both just sat
there quietly For her sake
Then I looked at her And she looked back at me And I said, "Um I think you have
somethin' in your teeth"
She turned away from me And then turned back and said, "Did I get it?" I said,
"Yeah, well, I mean, most of it But hey, ya know, don't sweat it"
Then she said, "How about now?" I said, "Yeah, almost There's still a little
bit there but don't worry It's probably just a piece of toast"
Now we're at the pay window Or whatever you call it Put my hand in my pocket I
can't believe there's no wallet!
And the lady at the window's like "Well well well, that'll be five eighty-two"
I turn around to my wife and say "How much have you got on you?"
She just rolls her eyes and says "I'll pay for this I guess" So she reaches
into her purse And busts out the American Express
I hand it to the lady And she says, "Oh dear It's gotta be cash only We don't
take credit cards here"
I took back the card and said "Gee, really? Well that sucks!" And that's when I
found out My wife was only carryin' three bucks
I said, "I thought you were Going to hit the ATM today" She says, "I never got
around to it So where's your wallet anyway?
And I said, "Nevermind Just help me to find some change" Now the lady at the
window Is looking at me kinda strange
And she says, "Mister, please We gotta move this line along" I said, "Now hold
your stinkin' horses lady We won't be long"
So I looked around inside the glove box And checked the mat beneath my feet I
found a nickel in an ashtray And a couple pennies and a dime in the space
between the seats
Before long I had a little pile Of coins of every sort The lady counts it up
and says "You're still about a dollar short"
And now my woman's got this weird look Frozen on her face She screams, "You
know I wasn't even really hungry in the first place"
And so I turned around To the cashier again I shrugged and said, "Okay Forget
the chicken sandwich then"
So I pick up my change Pick up my receipt And I drive to the pickup window Man,
I just can't wait to eat
And now we see this acne ridden Kid about sixteen Wearin' a dorky nametag that
says "Hello, my name is Eugene"
And he hands me a paper bag I look him in the eyes And I say to him "Hey,
Eugene Could I get some ketchup for my fries?"
Well he looks at me And I look at him And he looks at me And I look at him
And he looks at me And I look at him And he says, "I'm sorry What did you want
again?"
I say, "Ketchup!" And he says, "Oh yeah, that's right I just spaced out there
for a second I'm really kind of burnt tonight"
And then he hands me the ketchup And then we're finally drivin' away And the
food is drivin' me mad With its intoxicating bouquet
I'm starvin' to death By the time we pull up at the traffic light I say, "Baby,
gimme that burger I just gotta have a bite!"
So she reaches in the bag And pulls out the burger And she hands me the burger
And I pick up the burger
And then I unwrap the paper I bite into those buns And I just can't believe it
They forgot the onions!

Seven o'clock in the mornin'
And the rays from the sun wakes me
I'm stretchin' and yawnin'
In a bed that don't belong to me
And a voice yells "Good mornin', darlin', from the bathroom Then she comes out
and kisses me And to my surprise, she ain't you
Now I've got this dumb look on my face Like, what have I done? How could I be
so stupid To be have laid here til' the mornin' sun?
Must of lost the track of time Oh, what was on my mind? From the club, went to
her home Didn't plan to stay that long
Here I am, quickly tryin' to put on my clothes Searchin' for my car keys,
tryin' to get on up out the door Then she stretched her hands in front of it
Said, "You can't go this way"
Looked at her, like she was crazy Said, "Woman move out my way", said, "I got a
wife at home" She said, "Please don't go out there", "Lady, I've got to get
home" She said, "Her husband was comin' up the stairs "
"Shh, shh, quiet, hurry up and get in the closet" She said, "Don't you make a
sound Or some shit is goin' down" I said, "Why don't I just go out the window?"

"Yes, except for one thing, we on the 5th floor" "Shit think, shit think, shit
quick, put me in the closet" And now I'm in this dark ass closet, tryin' to
figure out Just how I'm gonna get my crazy ass up out this house
Then he walks in and yells, "I'm home" She says, "Honey, I'm in the room" He
walks in there with a smile on his face Sayin', "Honey, I've been missing you"
She hops all over him And says, "I've cooked and ran your bath water" I'm
tellin' you now This girl's so good that she deserves an Oscar
Throws her in the bed and start to snatchin' her clothes off I'm in the closet,
like man, what the fuck is goin' on? You're not gonna believe it But things get
deeper as the story goes on
Next thing you know A call comes through on my cell phone I tried my best to
quickly put it on vibrate But from the way he act, I could tell it was too late

He hopped up and said, "There's a mystery goin' on And I'm gonna solve it" And
I'm like "God please, don't let this man open this closet"
He walks in the bathroom And looks behind the door She says, "Baby, come back
to bed" He says, "Bitch, say no more"
He pulls back the shower curtain While she's bitin' her nails Then he walks
back to the room Right now, I'm sweatin' like hell
Checks under the bed then under the dresser He looks at the closet, I pull out
my Baretta He walks up to the closet, he comes up to the closet Now he's at the
closet, now he's openin' the closet


He looks around the kitchen, and says, Something is really weird
And she says, Why do you say that?
He says, Cos you keep tryin' to get me out of here
He said, Ever since I been in this house
Your face has went from white to red And remember when I first walked through
the door You acted like you had seen a ghost from the dead?
Then he says, Girl if you hidin' something, I'm gonna be so mad Then he hears
something fallin, he says, What the fuck was that? She said, It sounds like
it came from upstairs, sounds like the plumbing He said, Woman that sound did
not come from upstairs! I'll be damned if you're not up to something!"
He said, "Now the sound that I just heard, it came from this kitchen And then
he looks over by the stove, while shes easin' over by the dishes And then he
walks over to the refrigerator and pushes it back And then he looks her in her
face Looks like shes about to have a heart attack Then he notices the pie on
the counter, one slice is missing Now the storys gettin' scary, cos he comes
to realize That Bridget is allergic to cherries
Then he slowly looks up at her, and now her face is red as hell He's breathing
real hard, and movin' closer She says, Hon, you don't look so well And then
he says, Move She says, No He says, Move She says, No! Bitch move!
She moves
And then, he looks at the cabinet He walks to the cabinet Get close to the
cabinet Now he's opening the cabinet Now pause the movie, cos what I'm about
to say to ya'll is so damn twisted Not only is there a man in his cabinet But
the man is a midget!


Well, now he's staring at me like
As if he was starin' in a mirror
She yells, "Honey let me explain"
He says, "You don't have to go no further"
"I can clearly see what's goin' on Behind my back In my bed, in my home" Then I
said, "Wait a minute now hold on"
I said, "Mister we can work this out" She said, "Honey don't lose control"
Tried to get him to calm down He said, "Oh, I should've known"
"That you would go and do Some bogus shit up in my house But the Christian in
me gave You the benefit of the doubt"
I said, "We need to resolve this" Then he stepped to me, I'm like, "Whoa
There's a reason I'm in this closet" He says, "Yeah, like what are you talkin'
clothes?"
 club And she told me she didn't have
a man Then he said, "Man please, I'd kill you If you didn't have that gun in ya
hand"
And then I said, "But your chick chose me" He said, "Don't give me that mack
shit, please" His phone goes off and then things Get a little more interesting
He steps a little closer I point my gun and say, "I'm not the one you after" He
says, "Somethin' I bet you didn't know my man Did she tell you that I was a
pastor?"
I said, "Well, good that's betta right Why can't we handle this Christian like"
And I started to put the gun down 'Til I saw his face still had a frown
She started cryin' Sayin', "Baby I'm sorry" Then he said, "Baby, not as sorry
As you're gonna be"
And I started inchin' out He says, "No I want you to see this" Said, "I gotta
get out this house" He said "Not 'til I reveal my secret"
I'm like what is goin' on inside his head Then he takes his phone and calls
somebody up and says "Hello, baby, turn the car around Listen, I just need for
you to get right back here now"
Click, he looks at me and says "Well, since we're all comin' out the closet I'm
not about to be The only one that's broken hearted"
She said, "What do you mean?" And he said, "Just wait and see" I said,
"Somebody betta talk to me" And then his phone rang
He picks up and somebody says "Sweetheart, I'm downstairs" And he's like, "I'll
buzz you up I'm on the fifth floor, hurry take the stairs"
And I'm like, "Who is this mystery lady That you're talking to?" He says, "In
time you both Will know the shockin' truth"
"Baby, this is something I been wanting To get off my chest for a long, long
time" Then I said, "Now I'mma shoot you both If you don't say what's on ya
mind"
He said, "Wait I hear somebody comin' up the stairs" And I'm lookin' at the
door He says, "I think you betta sit down in the chair" I says, "I'm gonna
count to four"
One, he says, "Mister wait" Two, she says, "Please don't shoot" Three, he says,
"Don't shoot me" Four, she screams
Then a knock on the door The guns in my hands He opens the door I can't believe
it's a man


Believe it or not, I just started laughing
Shaking my head and just kept on laughing
Thinking about all the things I had been through that day
Then cries what why do you have that smile upon your face
Then I laughed out said thinking About the things that I've been through She
wipes her nose and she sniggles And laughs out I've been through it too
Then I start laughing again and she start laughing more Then next thing you
know we both are cracking up on the floor She laughs I can't believe this idiot
really answered my phone Now meanwhile Twon just got out of prison and he's on
his way home
Then she laughs baby I'm sorry For all the lies and all the bullshit Then I say
girl just wait till I tell you All the drama that I've been dealing with
She laughs I wanna hear it all Then I laugh and say baby first of all I got a
hangover, been trapped in the closet Slept who knows, threatened to kill a
pastor
She says, what baby This is no lie he had a lover turns out to be a gay guy She
says damn you've been through a lot Plus I gotta ticket
Meanwhile the policeman he turns around Just out of concern comes back to the
house Then he pulls up in the driveway My cars parked crooked with the lights
on
Then he goes around the back way He hear the dogs barking like somethings wrong
He gets to the backdoor and discover its been broken in He looks around, pulls
his gun out, then proceeds in [ From: http://www.metrolyrics.com/trapped-in-

Meanwhile were laughing and laughing and laughing But from his perspective he
thinks somebodies crying He gets closer to the bedroom And he would swear that
somebody was coughing and sighing
Meanwhile were in the bedroom laughing As I'm trying to continue to explain She
yells out Sylvester your killing me Said I swear that it went that way
Then next thing you know he bust up in the room Said bitch mutherfucker freeze
And then I looked back up at him And said wait your that damn police
Then she screams baby I mean James she says everything is cool And then he
yells Gwendolyn I got this I know your sick and tired off this fool
Then I stood up start walking toward him Screaming man get out my house Then he
yells freeze she scream Please and I pulled my barretta out
She cried out, Sylvester please don't Visions of him making love to her He said
man put the gun on the floor I can't thinking about him and her
I slowly put the gun and then I put my hands up. He winked at me and smiled And
that is when I went nuts Hopped all over him grabbed the gun
She screaming settle down Going all around both handling the gun Then all of a
sudden pow

There's total silence, blood everywhere
And confusion on their faces as they continue to stare
Then Gwen starts shakin' and cryin', screamin', "What did you do?!"
And then the policeman looks at me and screams
"See, now I warned you!"
Then he starts pacing the floor screamin' "God, what have we done here?!" And
she rushed to the door, blood on her hands screamin' "There goes your whole
career"
Meanwhile, I'm freakin' out sayin', "We gotta do somethin' And gotta do
somethin' quick" Then he picks up the gun and says, "I have a wife at home I
can't have no cause of this" She says, "James, I can't believe you just said
what you said 'Cause that's not what you was sayin' when your ass was in my
bed"
Then I said, "Get married later, but right now we gotta use our heads First of
all, did anybody think to check if the man was alive or dead?" Then he looks at
her, she looks at me I look at them and we look at him Meanwhile, Gwen's about
to have a nervous breakdown The way she's shakin' and cryin'
And then she screams, "You bastards! You've killed my brother!" And then I
said, "Gwen, wait a minute, I didn't" She says, "No, you killed my brother!"
She said, "He just got out of prison, he's been through a lot He was talking
about changin' his life and everything And to come home and get shot"
And I said, "Baby, it wasn't my fault, this man had a gun on me And besides,
how was I to know that you was getting down With this crooked ass policeman?"
And he says, "Wait a minute," I say, "No, you wait a minute!" And then I say,
"Man, this is my wife We had a life until you butted up in it!"
She cried out, "Sylvester, now hold on! Even though he was in our home Let's
not forget the fact that you was out there Creepin' in another man's home"
Twan starts coughin' And she says, "Twan! Oh my god! Baby brother, are you
okay?" He looks up at her and says, "I'm not gonna die, at least not today" And
then he asks what happened, and says, "Why did I get shot? Sylvester what is
this policeman doin' here?" And I said, "Go on, tell him cop"
He says, "Son, we gotta get you to a hospital And take a look at that wound"
Twan says, "No, I'm okay, it's just my shoulder All I need is a bathroom" Now
five minutes has gone by and they tellin' Twan everything that happened Twan
says, "Fuck man, I would've been better off in prison"
And now somebody's banging at the door and I'm like "Aw no! Here we go again!"
Thinkin' out loud to myself, sayin', "When is this shit gonna end?!" Then
Gwendolyn looks at me and says, "Baby, you got that?" And I say, "No!" She
says, "Why?" And I said, "Because I'm not Openin' up another motherfuckin'
door!"
And the cop says, "Gwen, I'll get it" Then looks at me and says, "Man of the
house, my ass!" Then I say, "I'll get it, but whoever it is I'm about to put
their ass on blast!"
And then the policeman grabbed me I snatched away and got my gun up off the
floor Then Twan says, "Man, that's what I'm talkin' about! Sylvester, point
that shit toward the door!"
Then he snatches the policeman's gun and says "Officer, arrest me later" I
count to three, Twan opened the door and it's Rosy the nosy neighbor
Ooh, with a spatula in her hand Like that's gon' do something against them guns
It's Rosy the nosy neighbor

True stories, miracles
(What? What?)
True blessings, all because of love
(What?)
True stories, miracles (What? What?) True blessings, all because of love
(What?)
I was riding in my car one day (Oh) In the express lane, rolling down the
freeway And suddenly the phone rings Then I reached down beside me
Then I looked on the floor, fell on the back seat See, I was drinking while I
was driving Never thinking 'bout what I was doing I turned around and before I
knew it Here comes this truck now
The doctor said, I dont think hes gonna make it Family said, Make the
funeral arrangements Unplug the machine, hes gone now Then told my wife to be
strong now
Then a small voice said on to me If you promise to stop drinking I
surrendered on that day And for 10 years, Ive been straight
You saved me, You saved me (Whoa) You saved me, You saved me, gave me a second
chance You saved me, You saved me You saved me, You saved me
Now Ive been sitting in the chair Waiting on the phone to ring Praying up to
God that someone Would call me with a job opening
'Cause it's been so hard for me month to month Struggling to eat but still
there was no answer (No answer) I stopped believing in His word and got so mad
at Him When somebody say God's good, I just laugh at them (Oh yeah)
And in the nick of time, His blessing rained on me By His grace the phone ring
A lady says, We're hiring And thats when I knew
You saved me, You saved me (Saved me) You saved me, You saved me, gave me a
second chance You saved me, You saved me You saved me, You saved me
Now I was 18, out on the block selling drugs With a gun at my waist and for
people had no love See, the streets was my home and family and friends were
gone Had no one to trust and deep inside, I was all alone
And then a deal went bad one day and it was enough to pause me I was shot 4
times and before I knew it, I was on my knees (Blood gushing out my body, my
heart's beatin' fast I dont know what Ima do, I dont think Im gonna last)
Then I began to flash back on the things Ive done in my past (Then I heard a
small voice that said to me Ill give you peace if you believe) I accepted
Christ that day, hallelujah, now Im free
You saved me, You saved me (Saved) You saved me, You saved me, gave me a second
chance You saved me, You saved me You saved me, You saved me
I was in the aisle of the grocery store With a pain in my chest and Im
wondering where did it come from (I got tested) And the results came back and
the doctor said Im sorry but you got cancer
I could not believe it, so I called up my mama to calm my nerve (Mama) She got
down on her knees, she said a prayer for me (Mama)
(Mama) Said just keep on thanking Jesus, Hell give you all you need (Mama)
That was five years ago, dont have that pain no mo' Doc says, You can go home
'cause all your cancer's gone
You saved me, You saved me (Said, You saved me) You saved me, You saved me,
gave me a second chance You saved me, You saved me You saved me, You saved me

I was so wrapped up in
All of the finer things
That I never took the time to show you
What you meant to me
Money, cars and ice Blingin' off the clothes I thought that I was hot Until you
turned cold
How could my success? Go and deceive me If I could turn it all back Then all of
this would be a dream to me
Baby, baby If you saw me in church on Sundays You could tell I've learn my
lesson well
Never said a prayer Oh like this Never shed a tear Until it was you I missed
Never fell in love Like a bottomless pit I was so, so tough Till you were up
and outta here
My pride had me thinking That being with me you were blessed Funny how you
could ask for so little And receive less
All of the fussing and fighting 'Cause I was always gone And even though I gave
you a lame excuse You still hung on
Oh, I don't blame you for leaving me But if I could turn it all back This would
be a dream to me
Baby, baby, baby If you could see me in church on Sundays You would say I've
learned my lesson well
Never said a prayer Never said a prayer like this no, no Never shed a tear
Until it was you I missed
Never fell in love Like a bottomless pit I was so, so tough Till you were up
and outta here
Never said a prayer Said a prayer like this baby Never shed a tear Until it was
you I missed
Never fell in love I was so, so tough Till you were up and outta here
Never said a prayer Said I never said a prayer like this Never shed a tear To
tough to shed a tear ooh baby
Never fell in love They could take all my positions hey Never said a prayer
Because love taught me a lesson baby
(Never shed a tear) See I've got to have you back (Never fell in love) See I've
got to have you back See I've got to have you back
(Never said a prayer) See I've got to have you back See I've got to have you
back
(Never shed a tear) Got to have you, got to have you Got to have you, got to
have you (Never fell in love) Got to have you, got to have you Got to have you,
got to have you Got to have you, hey oh
Never said a prayer Never shed a tear Never fell in love

Sick and tired of the games you played
Every move I make your ass got somethin' to say
Scandalize my name when you see it in the paper
Trying to turn it all around when it wasn't that way
Everybody is tryin' to figure me out What the hell is wrong with y'all? Just
let me live my life I can't go one day without y'all in my face Y'all have lost
y'all minds, if you don't hear what I say
Cops chase me when I'm standing still You know I ain't done shit wrong So why
you want me in your cell? You don't like my songs well, it pays the bills And
you cut me down 'cuz I keep it real
Sometimes I wanna fly far away from here To another place it ain't worth these
tears Sometimes at night when I close my eyes I know the haters are busy makin'
up hater lies
Sometimes I laugh tryin' to keep from cryin' If I was plain out of luck then
tell me who could I trust? See I work so hard just to get ahead If it wasn't
for God I'd probably be dead
Sometimes I think y'all tryin' to pull me down But y'all wastin' your time, I
got you haters figured out If you had your way it'd be lock and key Everywhere
I go trouble follows me Where the hell is my father? Shit, it hurts sometimes
There's a hole in me and it rocks my mind
Forgive me father for I have sinned When was your last confession?
His true fears he left without a care And that was more than I could bare When
you need my help I never tell you no When I need your love you got somewhere to
go
I'm gettin' sick of this shit but I'm not gonna quit I've come too far gotta
keep my pockets thick I get mad as hell but that's okay Kick off these shoes
'cuz I'm here to stay
I gotta let you know got no time to play So feel me and all that you hear me
say What I'm buildin' up, you can't tear it down 'Cuz it's built on solid
rockland ground
We don't die, we multiply Hit after hit, livin' platinum style Keep my head up
high, lookin' toward the sky Nothin' in my view, hey, I can fly
Y'all just hate I can't take no more And if you feel me Raise your hand and
show
This is what I feel Ooh, oh, oh, oh This is what I feel Feel me, feel me Feel
me, ooh, ooh Hey, hey, feel, ooh
West side tell me can you feel me? Hey, oh East side tell me can you feel me?
Whoa Oh, South, south side tell me can you feel me? Feel me, feel me, feel me,

forever indebted I'm forever indebted to her 'cause

I'm standing here, looking in the mirror
Saying "Damn" to myself
I should have known the day would come
That she would find somebody else
And all the things I took her through And I shouldn't have lasted this long
Now, I'm at this telephone booth, calling Tyrone
'Cuz when a woman's fed up (No matter how you beg, no) It ain't nothing you can
do about it (Nothing you can do about it) It's like running out of love (No
matter what you say, no) And then it's too late to talk about it (Too late to
talk about it)
Now let's talk about how it all goes down I used to make love to you daily When
the night fell the same And anytime that you were hurt I could feel your pain
And if I had a dollar It was yours, yeah And whenever we would go out I would
front the bill
But now the up is down And the silence is sound I hurt you too too many times
Now I can't come around
'Cuz when a woman's fed up (No matter how you beg, no) It ain't nothing you can
do about it, oh no (Nothing you can do about it) It's like running out of love
(No matter what you say, no) And then it's too late to talk about it, oh yeah
oh yeah (Too late to talk about it)
La da da da da la la da da La da da da da la la da da Listen If you don't want
to find out the hard way Then listen to this song while the record plays
When a woman's fed up (Mama thought me long time ago) It ain't nothing you can
do about it, oh no (Nothing you can do about it) It's like running out of love
(Running out of love, say goodbye) And then it's too late to talk about it,
yeah (Too late to talk about it)
When a woman's fed up (You can cry a river) ('Till an ocean starts to form,
yeah) It ain't nothing you can do about it (But she will always remember) ('Cuz
she's a woman scorned) It's like running out of love (If you ever get her back)
(It will never be the same) And then it's too late to talk about it (She's
cuttin' the corners of her eyes) (Every time she see your face)
When a woman's fed up (Now your trust is out the door) (She don't want you no
more) It ain't nothing you can do about it (You used to tell your boys, not me)
(And she would always be there for you) It's like running out of love (If you
had took the time to see) (What that woman meant to you) And then it's too late
to talk about it (Is what the mirror said to me, whoa)
When a woman's fed up (She was raised in Illinois) (Right outside of Chicago)
It ain't nothing you can do about it (Some of the best cookin' you ever had)
(Yes, it was) It's like running out of love (And I miss her) (Hey woman, if
you're listening) And then it's too late to talk about it (I said I miss you
baby)


When I wake up in the morning time and see the sun I say
Hallelujah, thank you Jesus for waking me up today
I think about His goodness and the wonderful things He's done
Forgiving me, setting me free and casting my sins away
And soon as I was about to fall You stepped right in on time Picked me up and
let me know, You had nothing but love for me And those lonely nights when I
thought that I was gonna lose my mind Lord, You were my company
And now I feel joy, when I think about You I feel strength, when I think about
You No pain, when I think about You And no rain, when I think about You
I get glad, when I think about You And raise my hands when I think about You
Shout Your name when I think about You When I think about You
And in the midst of the storm You were the shelter in my life Even though, I
was doing wrong and even though I fell off No one can help me out the way You
helped me whenever I was in need When trouble was chasing, I was weak You kept
your hands on me
My God, You sacrificed Your life that I might live for eternity Despite my
faults, You heard my cry Yes, you did and forgave my inequity No one can
understand the way You understand When it comes to my heart, Lord, you gave me
a brand new start
And now I feel joy, when I think about You Feel strength, when I think about
You There is no pain, when I think about You No rain, when I think about You
I get glad, when I think about You Raise my hands when I think about You And
shout Your name when I think about You Oh, Lord, when I think about You
Listen Even though your doubts will come Believe He gave His only son to all
the world He chose to love So how can we not send our praises up
I feel joy, when I think about You Feel strength, yeah, when I think about You
There's no rain when I think about You No more pain when I think about You
I get glad, ohh, when I think about You Then I raise my hands when I think
about You Shout your name when I think about You, oh, I When I think about You
I feel joy when I think about You And peace when I think about You Feel your
presence when I think about You Coming over me when I think about You
Then I start to fall, yeah, when I think about You Down to my knees when I
think about You And begin to pray when I think about You Lord, help me, when I
think about You
Then I see the light when I think about you Startin' to shine right through
when I think about you It's a brand new day when I think about you And my
heart's renewed when I think about you
And all my fears are gone when I think about you Gone Away when I think about
you When my day looks cloudy when I think about you It's gonna be okay when I
think about you
Yeah, ohh, when I think about you When I think about you Lord, how you gave me
love when I think about you And I gave you nothing when I think about you
How you woke me up, hey, when I think about you And started me on my way when I
think about you See you did not have to do it when I think about you But you
did it any old way when I think about you
Any old, any old, any old way when I think about you Yes you did, yes you did,
when I think about you Yes you did, yes you did when I think about you Yes you
did, when I think about you
Hey, hey, hey, hey, when I think about you Hey, hey, hey, hey, when I think
about you Hey, hey, hey, hey, when I think about you Hey, hey, hey, whoo
Oh yes, when I think about you When I think about you When I think about you
When I think about you

Another day has gone
I'm still all alone
How could this be
You're not here with me
You never said goodbye Someone tell me why Did you have to go And leave my
world so cold
Everyday I sit and ask myself How did love slip away Something whispers in my
ear and says That you are not alone For I am here with you Though you're far
away I am here to stay
You are not alone I am here with you Though we're far apart You're always in my
heart You are not alone
All alone Why, oh
Just the other night I thought I heard you cry Asking me to come And hold you
in my arms I can hear your prayers Your burdens I will bear But first I need
your hand So forever can begin
Everyday I sit and ask myself [ From: http://www.metrolyrics.com/you-are-not-
 How did love slip away Then something whispers in
my ear and says That you are not alone For I am here with you Though you're far
away I am here to stay For you are not alone I am here with you Though we're
far apart You're always in my heart And you are not alone
Whisper three words and I'll come runnin' And girl you know that I'll be there
I'll be there
You are not alone I am here with you Though you're far away I am here to stay
You are not alone I am here with you Though we're far apart You're always in my
heart
You are not alone For I am here with you Though you're far away I am here to
stay
For you are not alone For I am here with you Though we're far apart You're
always in my heart
For you are not alone

Ooh I'm so excited, I can't help it, I'm so fortunate to be here with you girl
And I promise that you are the only one for me out of every single woman in the
world, yes you are
And it's so much joy in the things that you do, how you do, when you do those
things you do to me
Let us lay down baby and imitate the lifestyles of the birds and bees, mmhm

see Baby you bring me joy
Chorus
You bring me joy, night and day Girl you and me should get away I've got this
special hideaway Where you and me can be alone (lovin' ya body all night long)
You bring me joy, night and day Girl you and me should get away I've got this
special hideaway Where you and me can be alone
Ooh baby this love makin' is so good I just don't know what to do with myself,

And I'm sittin here thinkin' God 'cause girl he could've place you with
somebody else, uh
The way you walk, the way you dress, your smile, your grace, your sex Girl,

Chorus
 Baby

True stories, miracles
(What? What?)
True blessings, all because of love
(What?)
True stories, miracles (What? What?) True blessings, all because of love
(What?)
I was riding in my car one day (Oh) In the express lane, rolling down the
freeway And suddenly the phone rings Then I reached down beside me
Then I looked on the floor, fell on the back seat See, I was drinking while I
was driving Never thinking 'bout what I was doing I turned around and before I
knew it Here comes this truck now
The doctor said, I dont think hes gonna make it Family said, Make the
funeral arrangements Unplug the machine, hes gone now Then told my wife to be
strong now
Then a small voice said on to me If you promise to stop drinking I
surrendered on that day And for 10 years, Ive been straight
You saved me, You saved me (Whoa) You saved me, You saved me, gave me a second
chance You saved me, You saved me You saved me, You saved me
Now Ive been sitting in the chair Waiting on the phone to ring Praying up to
God that someone Would call me with a job opening
'Cause it's been so hard for me month to month Struggling to eat but still
there was no answer (No answer) I stopped believing in His word and got so mad
at Him When somebody say God's good, I just laugh at them (Oh yeah)
And in the nick of time, His blessing rained on me By His grace the phone ring
A lady says, We're hiring And thats when I knew
You saved me, You saved me (Saved me) You saved me, You saved me, gave me a
second chance You saved me, You saved me You saved me, You saved me
Now I was 18, out on the block selling drugs With a gun at my waist and for
people had no love See, the streets was my home and family and friends were
gone Had no one to trust and deep inside, I was all alone
And then a deal went bad one day and it was enough to pause me I was shot 4
times and before I knew it, I was on my knees (Blood gushing out my body, my
heart's beatin' fast I dont know what Ima do, I dont think Im gonna last)
Then I began to flash back on the things Ive done in my past (Then I heard a
small voice that said to me Ill give you peace if you believe) I accepted
Christ that day, hallelujah, now Im free
You saved me, You saved me (Saved) You saved me, You saved me, gave me a second
chance You saved me, You saved me You saved me, You saved me
I was in the aisle of the grocery store With a pain in my chest and Im
wondering where did it come from (I got tested) And the results came back and
the doctor said Im sorry but you got cancer
I could not believe it, so I called up my mama to calm my nerve (Mama) She got
down on her knees, she said a prayer for me (Mama)
(Mama) Said just keep on thanking Jesus, Hell give you all you need (Mama)
That was five years ago, dont have that pain no mo' Doc says, You can go home
'cause all your cancer's gone
You saved me, You saved me (Said, You saved me) You saved me, You saved me,
gave me a second chance You saved me, You saved me You saved me, You saved me


Everyday and night I pray
Love will swing you back this way
Life without you here with me
Ain't the same without you G
Baby hear me, I never meant to hurt you Baby come and talk to me Let me know
what's on your mind Every time I see you You're running from me all the time
Baby hear me, I never meant to hurt you I only wanted you to be happy You to
have the best of things To be down with me, baby 'Cause your lovin', it's so
good
You're giving me the run-around Thought our love was going down Baby don't you
know That I'm down until the day I die Baby hear me, never meant to hurt you
Now you know I'll never do anything to hurt you 'Cause baby I love you
Every night and day I pray Your love returns Oh I'd give my life If it would
only make you happy [ From: http://www.metrolyrics.com/you-to-be-be-happy-
