<i>[1]</i> - Did you ever think that you would be this rich<br>
Did you ever think that you would have these hits<br>
Did you ever think that you would be the don<br>
Have a crib with a fifty acre lawn<br>
<br>
Did you ever think that you would be this paid<br>
Were there times when your ass was real afraid<br>
Did you ever think that you would sell out tours<br>
Have a show with fifty million viewers<br>
<br>
I used to think about how I was gonna make it<br>
Struggling day to day just trying to get this paper<br>
Hoping the day would come when things would go my way<br>
But now I'm living lavish and all I do is hear them say<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
Now I've been around the world and seen so many things<br>
Partied in every club nothing but VIP<br>
I never take for granted these luxuries I have<br>
Just try my best to answer all of these questions that I ask<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
I used to play the game, at night the same old same<br>
Dreamin' about city lights it was my only lie<br>
And now it's world wide shows<br>
As if I can fly on over <br>
Now I can't go nowhere without the whole world due to know<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
I used to dream about this life<br>
Now I'm sitting on first class flights<br>
Now they all wanna know<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1 until fade]</i>
