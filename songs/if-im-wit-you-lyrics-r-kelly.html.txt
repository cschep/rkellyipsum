I don't understand, I do all this for you
You contemplating on me or is it him?
Or is it me? Or is it him?
He told you he'd be there for you and he wasn't
I told you I'd be there for you and I was And still is the real is who takes
care of biz Took you from apartments and got you home like the wiz
I'm not the kind of guy to give you everything But if you're real then you can
get some ice in your rings You and me straight to the crib off the tour bus
Spottin' my eyes fireplace big as us
It really don't matter, who's first in the shower Fruit platter from a young
maid every hour And when it comes down to the dollar You can have it all ya
gotta do is keep it hoppin' like a rabbit
Friends come around don't be ready to change Treat me like a stepchild when I'm
up on my game Remember I'm the first to give your cootie the pain So I wanna
hear you answer when I ask you my name
Ooh baby I want you here with me And give you everything that your heart
desires Lady can you feel me? Do you wanna be with me for always?
Baby can't you see what you've done to me? When he do the things that he has
done to you baby
You don't need nobody to love you You don't need nobody to kiss you You don't
need nobody to please you 'Cuz I can do those things if I'm with you
Now who took you in when that nigga put you out? And who picked you up when
that nigga put you down? Restraining orders keep that fool from around Had to
set you up in a spot downtown
See I was the one who was there for you But I'm not the one gonna play the two
Channel bags in the trunk, what you gon' do? You could treat the future like a
menu
As long as I'm the only one to bend you And when you wanna take a flight I'm
the one to send you Never be the one that's out to hurt you Tell you that I'm
there and then desert you
You don't need nobody to love you You don't need nobody to kiss you You don't
need nobody to please you 'Cuz I can do those things if I'm with you
You don't need nobody to love you You don't need nobody to kiss you You don't
need nobody to please you 'Cuz I can do those things if I'm with you
Baby, can't you see what you've done to me? When he do the things he do to you,
baby
You don't need nobody to love you You don't need nobody to kiss you You don't
need nobody to please you 'Cuz I can do those things if I'm with you
You don't need nobody to love you You don't need nobody to kiss you You don't
need nobody to please you 'Cuz I can do those things if I'm with you
You don't need nobody to love you You don't need nobody to kiss you You don't
need nobody to please you 'Cuz I can do those things if I'm with you
You don't need nobody to love you You don't need nobody to kiss you You don't
need nobody to please you
