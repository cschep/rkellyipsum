you used to be so many colors to me
now when i look at you,
all i see is clear
and nothing else in this world
mattered to me just as long as i had you near i step right off the highest
mountain thinking i can walk the sky tell me and i would believe but this would
be the last time you make me cry cause i can see you're nothing but a smoke
screen
a ghost you're nothing but a ghost to me a ghost and you don't exist no more
nothing but a ghost to me a ghost and you don't exist no more see you used to
be my dream now all you do is haunt me go, go go
i used to think heaven  when i looked at you  because you were an angel to me
but now all this hell that you took me through baby,you lost your wings i used
to feel like i was on top of the world with you i would go anywhere but then i
woke up at the bottom of the surf and saw you both lying ahead
a ghost you're nothing but a ghost to me [ From: http://www.metrolyrics.com/
 a ghost and you don't exist no more nothing but a
ghost to me a ghost and you don't exist no more see you used to be my dream now
all you do is haunt me go, go, go
go, just go, just go, go
you used to love me  and now slowly i see u drifting  ever since you broke my
heart in two i don't wanna have nothing to do with you and even though i still
love you more i've got to walk away from the heart i've got my strength cause i
can do this scratch your name from my list
a ghost you're nothing but a ghost to me a ghost and you don't exist no more
nothing but a ghost to me a ghost and you don't exist no more see you used to
be my dream now all you do is haunt me go, go, go
go, just go, just go, go
a ghost you're nothing but a ghost to me a ghost and you don't exist no more
nothing but a ghost to me a ghost and you don't exist no more see you used to
be my dream now all you do is haunt me and go, go, go
