Two strippers, in my hotel suite<br>

Blue rocks lightin up my shoulders (bling!)<br>
See y'all niggaz know y'all need to grow up<br>

Wanna run our ways, doin R&B<br>

Pull up on the block, cran-apple Benz<br>
White tank top, cran-apple trim<br>
Egg-shaped watch, cran-apple gems<br>
Dice hands 'side both of them<br>
Two rolls and I leave with a stack<br>
Off to the club, G's in in the back<br>
