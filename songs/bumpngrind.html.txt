My mind is telling me no but my body my body's telling me yes<br>
I (baby) don't want to hurt nobody<br>
But there is something that I must confess........... (chill)<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus: repeat 4x]</i><br>
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind<br>
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind<br>
<br>
See I know just what you want and I know just what you need girl<br>
So baby bring your body to me (bring your body here)<br>
I'm not fooling around with you baby<br>
My love is true (with you) with you is where I want to be, girl see<br>
you need someone someone like me to satisfy your every needs<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus 4x]</i><br>
<br>
You say he's not treating you right<br>
Then lady spend the night now<br>
I'll love you like you need to be love (girl why don't you try some of me)<br>
No need to look no more because I've opened up my door<br>
You'll never feel another love you see<br>
you need someone, someone like me girl to make love to you baby constantly<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus 4x]</i>
