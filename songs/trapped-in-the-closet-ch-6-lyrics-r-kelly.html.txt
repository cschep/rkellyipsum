Believe it or not, I just started laughing
Shaking my head and just kept on laughing
Thinking about all the things I had been through that day
Then she cries, "What? Why do you have that smile upon your face?"
Then I laughed out, said "Thinking about all the things I been through" She
wipes her nose and she sniffles and laughs out "I been through it too"
Then I start laughing again And she start laughing more Then next thing you
know we're both are Cracking up on the floor
She laughs out, "I can't believe This idiot really answered my phone" Now
meanwhile Twon just got out of prison And he's on his way home
Then she yells, "Baby, I'm sorry for all the lies and all the bore" Then I say,
"Girl, just wait till I tell all the drama That I been dealing with" She
laughs, "I wanna hear it all"
Then I laugh and say, "Baby, first of all I got a hangover, been trapped in the
closet Slept with who knows, threatened to kill a pastor" She says, "What? Baby
know now he had a lover turns out To be a gay guy" She says, "Damn, you been
through a lot, plus I got a ticket"
Meanwhile, the police, he turns around Just out of concern, comes back to the
house Then he pulls up in the driveway My car's parked with the lights on Then
he goes around the back way He hear the dog barking like somethings wrong
He gets to the back door And discovers it's been broken in He looks around,
pulls his gun out Then he proceeds in
Meanwhile, we're laughing and laughing and laughing From his perspective he
thinks that somebody's crying He gets closer to the bedroom and he would swear
That somebody's coughing and sighing
Meanwhile, we in the bedroom laughing As I'm trying to continue to explain She
yells out, "Sylvester your killing me" I said, "I swear baby it went that way
Then next thing you know he bust up in the room And say, "Mothafucker freeze"
And then I looked back up at him and said "Wait your that damn police"
Then she scream, "Baby, I mean James" She says "Everything is cool" And then he
yells, "Gwendolyn, I got this I know your sick and tired of this fool"
Then I stood up, started walking Toward him screaming, "Man, get out my house"
Then he yells, "Freeze" She scream, "Please"
Then I pull my biretta out Then she cried out "Sylvester please don't" Then I
started thinking about him making love to her He said, "Man, put the gun on the
floor" I can't stop thinking about him and her
I slowly put the gun down And then I put my hands up He winked at me and smiled
And that is when I went nuts
Hopped all over him round the gun She screaming, "Settle down" Going all around
the room Both hands on the gun and all of a sudden pow
