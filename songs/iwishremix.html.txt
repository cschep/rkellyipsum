Yo', what up, my n****<br>
You know I was in the hood<br>
I just thought I'd stop by<br>
Holler at you for a minute<br>
Pour out a little liquor or some'in'<br>
<br>
N****, we done been through a lot of s*** together<br>
From runnin' these streets to bein' down for whatever<br>
And now that you're gone I got a whole lot of s*** to<br>
tell you<br>
Things I should've said way back when we was younger<br>
<br>
Remember when we used to roll hand in hand<br>
And now I'm trippin' on how I really miss you, man<br>
And remember when you and me would say<br>
We'd get up out this hood and everything would be okay<br>
<br>
It's all good now (My n****)<br>
We out the hood now (Mmm)<br>
We had the same ideas, but not the same careers<br>
We shared the same old laugh, and now the same tears<br>
<br>
You were my homie, my sconey, my Roni<br>
My n**** and never placed no b**** before me<br>
Man, I sear to God I love for that s***<br>
Why'd you have to get hit<br>
Where was I, what time was it<br>
<br>
You were supposed to get older with me<br>
On stage, hands on shoulders with me<br>
Coppin' them Range Rovers with me<br>
Sittin' on thangs and smokin' trees<br>
<br>
And if it wasn't for the will that God had made<br>
I'd turn back the hands of time and take your place<br>
Sittin' here sippin' on this Hennessy<br>
Just thinkin' about how much you meant to me (My n***)<br>
<br>
Even when you're gone you will always be my n****<br>
When you went home I'm still missin' you, my n****<br>
I'm feelin' like the timing was wrong, my n****<br>
I know you're smilin' down sayin' carry on, my n****<br>
<br>
Some times my nights can get long, my n****<br>
Some times I feel God did me wrong, my n****<br>
So I had to write a song, my n****<br>
Just to let you know that you're still my n****<br>
<br>
I wish, I wish, I wish (Oh, I)<br>
I wish, I wish, I wish<br>
<br>
Little son is lookin' at me like, "Where is my daddy?"<br>
And your 13-year old daughter is mad Â¡Rcause she<br>
understands<br>
Promised your mama I'd take care of the family<br>
But she's so hurt, she turns away my helpin' hands<br>
<br>
Damn, I wish your a** was here, my n****<br>
To grow that gray beard and smoke that cigar, my n****<br>
And we would talk about you gettin' up out this game<br>
And you would tell me how it keeps callin' your name<br>
<br>
(We used to ride-ride-ride)<br>
Never afraid to (Die-die-die)<br>
But some times we (Cry-cry-cry)<br>
Askin' the Lord (Why-why-why)<br>
They're tearin' down these projects<br>
<br>
We were homies for like 20 thug years<br>
Sat in church and cried the same thug tears<br>
You remember when Vibe World Premier<br>
How we used to share the same old gear<br>
<br>
And remember when you and me would say<br>
We'd get up out this hood and everything would be okay<br>
<br>
(It's all good now) My n****<br>
We out the hood now<br>
It's so easy for folks to say, "Rob, just live on"<br>
When I'm dyin' every second that you're gone<br>
Nevertheless I try my best to be strong<br>
Hopin' you said your prayers before you went on home<br>
<br>
When we stood on these blocks and just shot the breeze<br>
We'd slapbox dead in the middle of streets<br>
And if a fight broke out, you would take up for me<br>
You're all I have left of these ghetto memories<br>
<br>
I wish, I wish, I wish (Oh, I)<br>
I wish, I wish, I wish<br>
<br>
Uh, uh, yo' dog, I can't explain how I miss you<br>
We stayed together, coppin' cane, poppin' pistols<br>
I miss you most<br>
Puttin' the doo rag over your bean head<br>
Even out the hood on the scene you brag (Whoa)<br>
Comin' up off the fiends for bags<br>
Runnin' up out the cleaners, drag<br>
You was the closest n**** I had<br>
Look how we stayed aces<br>
Hustled, made big faces<br>
I wish we could trade places<br>
F*** givin' you ice, I'd rather give you life<br>
And the things that I had, I'd give you twice (Oh,yeah)<br>
<br>
So what the deal, my n****, I know you holdin' it down<br>
If you could see me you would say I'm talkin' soft<br>
right now<br>
But it's hard for me to see when I'mma see you again<br>
And I know it's f***ed up, I gotta talk through this<br>
pen<br>
But you'd died for the love of the dough<br>
The love of the block, 16 you was runnin' the spot<br>
Boy, your mama used to hate how we stood on the curb<br>
Hangin' with wild thug n****s, smokin' the herb (Mmm,<br>
hmm, hmm)<br>
I'm gonna keep pourin' this liquor and that's my word<br>
This here is for n****s that be flippin' them birds<br>
(Oh)<br>
Word up!<br>
<br>
Even though you know you will always be my n****<br>
(Whoa...whoa...oh...oh..)<br>
Even though you're gone you will also be my n****<br>
I'm feelin' like the time when I'm high, my n**** <br>
<br>
I'm feelin' like time<br>
I'm strung out, sayin', "Radio, please don't take the<br>
n**** out this song<br>
Let it play on, go on, on<br>
So I had to write this song, my n****<br>
Just to let you know that you're still my n****
