Every night up in the club getting money with the thugs thought I'd never fall
in love (what what)
Then there was you (what what)
And I don't wanna be a player no more
Every night in the club trickin with a different girl thought I'd never fall in
love (what what)
Then I met you (what what) Girl you changed my mind
