{This goes out to all of those that were lost in Virginia
Parents, families, friends, we light a candle
And let you know that Virginia will rise again}
I know you're feeling pain right now
And you don't wanna talk right now I know you're going through something And
you don't wanna be bothered right now
Not gonna lie and say I understand I just wanna be here for you if I can To
hold your hand and be by your side And together we will get through these times

And we will cry together And we'll fight this together And we'll be strong
together Stand together, pray together
Rise up, when you feel you can't go on Rise up, when all of your hope is gone
Rise up, when you're weak and you can't be strong Rise up
Rise up, and when the tears start to fall Rise up, and you feel you've given it
your all Rise up, when your back is up against the wall Rise, rise up
Now I know the burdens that you've had And you don't think nobody cares A storm
comes out of nowhere And you're feeling like it just ain't fair
Not here to preach about the private side, no 'Cause I understand and now is
not the time See I just wanna help you make it right Walk with you, holding the
candle light
And we will cry together And we'll fight this together And we'll be strong
together Stand together, pray together
Rise up, when you feel you can't go on Rise up, when all of your hope is gone
Rise up, when you're weak and you can't be strong Rise up
Rise up, and when the tears start to fall Rise up, and you feel you've given it
your all Rise up, when your back is up against the wall Rise
You see struggle, struggle has No color, no color In the midst of crisis You
are my sister and I'm your brother
And side by side we'll face this thing Standing tall, you and me
Rise up, rise Rise up, rise
Rise up, rise (Hey we gon' rise) Rise up (Heads up to to the sky)
Rise up, rise (When all hope is gone) Rise up, rise (We'll stand tall and
believe)
Rise up, rise (And we gotta know tomorrow will come) Rise (And we will have a
victory)
Rise up, rise (Hey, rise up) Rise up, rise (Hey)
Rise up, rise (In the middle, in the middle of your storm when you) Rise (When
you think you, when you think you cannot make it, rise up)
Rise up, rise (God bless you Virginia) Rise up, rise (Our hearts go out to you
and your families)
Rise up, rise Rise up
Rise up
