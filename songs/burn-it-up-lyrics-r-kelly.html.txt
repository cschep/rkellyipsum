Burn it up
Girl, make it hot like the roof is on fire
Burn it up
Girl, the way you dance you are my one desire
Come on, so hot you're on fire Come on, so hot you're on fire Come on, so hot
you're on fire Come on, so hot you're on fire
Come on, so hot you're on fire Come on, so hot you're on fire Come on, so hot
you're on fire Come on
When you roll it, I cant control it And when you throw it, its hard to catch
it And when you shake it, I pray you dont break it And when you drop it girl,
I cannot take it
Something about the way you move (Hey) Sweat is dripping all over you (Hey) The
way you let the beat take over you (Hey) Baby, dont stop, keep it going make
it hot (Hey)
The way you put your back in motion, mama I love the way you freakin it, mama
You got me comin' out of V.I.P, mama 'Cause you look like the girl in my dreams
(Mama)
I step up in the club, first thing I see is you freakin it Your eyes and body
language tells me you want me to hit it
Well, I say girl, back that thing up to me Closer, a little closer, work it
Come on and shake it on me now, work it Come on and work it on me now, work it
Girl, it's getting heated now, work it It's time to put this club on fire now
Burn it up Girl, make it hot like the roof is on fire Burn it up Girl, the way
you dance you are my one desire Burn it up Girl, I dont care if the whole
place burn down Burn it up, burn it up, burn it up
Calor, sudor Bailando reggaeton Calor, sudor Sigue bailando y no pares Calor,
sudor Bailando reggaeton Calor, sudor Pide mas, quiere mas, pegate y dale
Sientan mi fuego muchacha, dale guaracha Tembleque tembleque pa que tiemblen
