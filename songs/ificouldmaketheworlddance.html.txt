Signs and wonders that the television shows<br>
Hate and poverty for the more, lets me know<br>
That life is a stage and we're all in the show<br>
Starring the World, cause we all blow<br>
<br>
(Heaven I'm calling, heaven I'm calling)<br>
If we just give each other a chance<br>
(Heaven I'm calling, heaven I'm calling)<br>
We might just fall in love<br>
<br>
Picture us (in a land)<br>
Where there's no more (no more war)<br>
Shaking hands with my (brother)<br>
And respecting my my my (my sisters)<br>
(I'm offering) a dance that heals<br>
(A melody) you can feel<br>
Love is the key<br>
All it takes is you and me<br>
<br>
If I could make the world dance (whoa if I could make them dance)<br>
Then they would dance something like this<br>
If I could make the world groove (whoa if I could make them groove)<br>
Then they would groove something like this<br>
If I could make the world sing (whoa if I could make them sing)<br>
Then they would sing something like this<br>
If I could make the world love (if I could make them love, if I could make the love one another)<br>
Then it would be something like this<br>
<br>
Tell me why can't more hungry people overcome<br>
When they've got the means to build bombs, yeah<br>
We're so quick to say God Bless America<br>
But take away In God We Trust<br>
Tell me what the hell is wrong with us<br>
<br>
(Heaven I'm calling, heaven I'm calling)<br>
If we just give each other a chance then<br>
(Heaven I'm calling, heaven I'm calling)<br>
We might just fall in love<br>
<br>
Picture us (in a land)<br>
Where there's no more (no more war)<br>
Shaking hands with my (brothers)<br>
And respecting my (sisters)<br>
I'm offering (I'm offering) a dance that heals<br>

If I could make the world groove (whoa if I could make them groove)<br>
Then they would groove something like this<br>
If I could make the world sing (whoa if I could make them sing)<br>
Then they would sing something like this (if I could make the world)<br>
If I could make the world love<br>
Then it would be something like this<br>
<br>

People, there's got to be <br>
A place that we can go<br>
And dance out the day<br>
So meet me at the <br>
Spot that we used to go<br>
And just step the night away<br>
Please let's just rewind time<br>
And go back because I miss those days<br>
<br>
If I could make the world dance (woah if I could make them dance)<br>
Then they would dance something like this<br>
If I could make the world groove (woah if I could make them groove)<br>
Then they would groove something like this<br>
If I could make the world sing (woah if I could make them sing)<br>
Then they would sing just like this (if I could make the world love)<br>
If I could make the world love (I surely would)<br>
Then it would be something like this<br>
<br>
If I could make the world (if I)<br>
If I could make the world (could make)<br>
If I could make the world (the world)<br>
If I could make the world (oh if I)<br>
If I could make the world (oh I)<br>
If I could make the world <br>
If I could make the world...<br>
<br>
Chocolate Factory<br>
If I could make the world dance<br>
I truly would<br>
Marvin Gaye inspired me to write that one ya'll<br>
Just as Frankie Beverley inspired me to write love street<br>
You know every day is a special occasion ya'll<br>
You know why? Cause you woke up this morning<br>
Happy People baby
