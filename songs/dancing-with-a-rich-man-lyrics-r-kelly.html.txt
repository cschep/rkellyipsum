Entrea
Ay, tantas cosas que quiero
Decirte yo quiero
Hacer por ti
But first we must dance
Private cotillion style One lady's fantasy Trip to Milan tonight Exclusive
shopping spree
Mansions await, your scent That smells just like treasure Dining with me in
suites That overlooks the shore
As we move, then we touch, then we dip Dancin' with a rich man As we move, then
we touch, then we dip Shall we dance, shall we dance, shall we dance? As we
turn, then we stare, then we kiss Dancin' with a rich man As we turn, then we
stare, then we kiss
Kissing the feet of you While listening to bonsais And your angelic grace
Wearing Victoria
Passionate love with you Hearing you, "Oh, oui oui" Some antique jewelry from
Kenshires gallery
As we move, then we touch, then we dip Dancin' with a rich man As we move, then
we touch, then we dip Shall we dance, shall we dance, shall we dance? As we
turn, then we stare, then we kiss Dancin' with a rich man As we turn, then we
stare, then we kiss
And when you'll elevate Like visions of grandeur Mademoiselle and me Behind the
villa doors
Sunsets on yellow sand Thats where we rendezvous Chapels of Valentine Is just
to name a few
As we move, then we touch, then we dip Dancin' with a rich man As we move, then
we touch, then we dip As we turn, then we stare, then we kiss Dancin' with a
rich man As we turn, then we stare, then we kiss
As we move, then we touch, then we dip Dancin' with a rich man As we move, then
we touch, then we dip Shall we dance, shall we dance, shall we dance? As we
turn, then we stare, then we kiss Dancin' with a rich man As we turn, then we
stare, then we kiss
