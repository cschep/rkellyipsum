<i>[1]</i> - I say the easiest thing in the world<br>
Is to love you<br>
And the hardest thing in the world<br>
Is to lose you<br>
<br>
Said I tried and tried again to keep you <br>
But it just ain't no use<br>
I'm baffled cuz of what went down<br>
See I got your letter so you're leaving town<br>
Just take one minute to think about<br>
Baby, lets back track on what happened in this house<br>
Now I remember clearly it was a Saturday<br>
I came walkin' in four o'clock in the morning<br>
And I thought you were sleepin' one eye opened<br>
You turned and said to me where the hell you been<br>
Then I turned it around and hollared with some friends drinking<br>
And now I'm sitting here all alone<br>
Wishing you were here to house this home, oh<br>
<br>
Say the easiest thing in the world is to love you <br>
I love you baby<br>
And the hardest thing in the world (So hard) <br>
Is to lose you (Is to lose you baby)<br>
<br>
<i>[2]</i> - Now I'm sitting here sippin' on things <br>
I'm not suppose to (Sittin right here)<br>
And that ain't cool (You know that ain't cool)<br>
I've got to get over losing you<br>
<br>
Shattered I can't believe you're gone<br>
I'm left in the middle of these four walls<br>
Lying helpless 'bout to lose my mind baby<br>
I can't fathom life without you by my side<br>
Now every night before I go to sleep<br>
I pray to heaven for a better me<br>
Nights I'm up thinkin' and days I'm up dreamin' <br>
You were at work I was at play<br>
A nigga wanted you and plus his cake<br>
I know I ain't got no right to say<br>
But I need you to head on back this way<br>
Because I'm sitting here all alone<br>
Wishing you were here to house this home<br>
<br>

<br>
Baby can't we just moan for love like we used to<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<i>[Repeat 2]</i><br>
<br>
See, sometimes we men, we can dish it out<br>
But sometimes we men, we can't take it, hey<br>
So I'm gonna get up out this chair<br>
And catch me a train, and get where you are, hey<br>
Because I love you babe<br>
And i need you <br>
Right here by my side<br>
Ghetto woman come on home to me<br>
I'm dying sorry and I can't seem to break free
