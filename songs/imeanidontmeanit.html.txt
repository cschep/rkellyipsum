<i>[Intro]</i><br>
Yeah, like I was saying<br>
I ain't, ya know what<br>
I'm not tryin' to say things to hurt you<br>
You know what I'm saying<br>
I don't wanna hurt you, baby<br>
Just sometimes you do things <br>
That push me to say things I don't wanna say<br>
You know what I'm saying?<br>
You know I love you<br>
You know I care about you<br>
This time, you just brought it on yourself<br>
Yo, check it out<br>
<br>
Now I shoulda been more man<br>
About the way things went down<br>
Especially since we been dealin' <br>
For like seven years now<br>
I've been slowly, slowly bringing you down<br>
No conversation, no good sex in a while<br>
But still you search and find a way<br>
To love me somehow<br>
Even though I ride, you still trust me somehow<br>
Got my faces, some ice and a tie<br>
Slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly goin' down<br>
<br>
(I don't mean it) When I hollar at you <br>
(I don't mean it) When I say that we're through <br>
(I don't mean it) What I'm takin' you through <br>
(I don't mean it) Baby <br>
(I don't mean it) Said I'm sorry <br>
(I don't mean it) Can you find a way to forgive me<br>
(I don't mean it) Said I went to church this morning <br>
(I don't mean it) I don't mean it<br>
<br>
Running around here talking about <br>
How I'm a big player now<br>
Hidden in corners, blinging out our share<br>
Kelly makin' hits now<br>
Thinking about this industry <br>
And how I put it out<br>
You were there for me <br>
When I used dish rags for ties<br>
There's times that I didn't hear you<br>
I was talkin' too loud<br>
When I didn't come home<br>
I was hanging with the crowd<br>
Whenever we fight I try to win every round<br>
Can you find a way to forgive me now<br>
<br>
(I don't mean it) Cuz I don't mean it<br>
(I don't mean it) When I hollar at you<br>
(I don't mean it) Whenever I say we're through<br>
(I don't mean it) Whoa<br>
(I don't mean it) Can you find a way to forgive<br>
(I don't mean it) Ooh baby, I<br>
(I don't mean it) I went to church this mornin'<br>
(I don't mean it) Ooh I don't mean it<br>
<br>
<i>[R.]</i> Father, can you help me?<br>
<i>[Priest]</i>What do you need from me?<br>
<i>[R.]</i> I broke up with my girl and I'm feelin' kinda lonely<br>
<i>[Priest]</i>I been watching you from Heaven, Kelly<br>
You been so demanding<br>
You need to read my word, son<br>
And get some understanding<br>
<i>[R.]</i> But I been busy with my music<br>
<i>[Priest]</i>Stop making excuses<br>
Recognize the love she gives<br>
And try not to abuse it<br>
<i>[R.]</i> Is it too late to get her back?<br>
<i>[Priest]</i>Not as long as I'm a fact<br>
<i>[R.]</i> Well father, show me a sign<br>
That will make her mine<br>
<br>
(I don't mean it) I don't mean it<br>
(I don't mean it) Whenever I say we're through<br>
(I don't mean it) Or whenever I hollar at you<br>
(I don't mean it) Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh<br>
(I don't mean it) Ooh baby, ooh baby<br>
(I don't mean it) See what was straight is now stone<br>
(I don't mean it) Because I took you for granted, oh<br>
(I don't mean it) Whoa<br>
(I don't mean it) Whoa you should know I don't mean it<br>
(I don't mean it) I put it on my life<br>
(I don't mean it) Believe me I pay the price<br>
(I don't mean it) When I was down and out<br>
(I don't mean it) You reached out your hand<br>
(I don't mean it) I've learned it takes a good woman<br>
(I don't mean it) To raise a man<br>
(I don't mean it) Oh, I love you baby<br>
(I don't mean it) Oh oh oh I love you baby
