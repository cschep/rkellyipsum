I can see my destination
I can hear my call
No more hesitation
This time I'm goin' for it all
'Cause I know where this road leads to And therefore I will rise I know this
dream will come true And I will soar the sky
Spirit, spirit, would you guide me Spirit, oh spirit, stand by me Come on, come
on, come on Set me free
I can feel the penetration Of a strong wind movin' me I feel can the elevation
Of an angel lifting me
'Cause I know where this road leads to Therefore I will rise I know this dream
will come true And I will soar the sky
Spirit, spirit, would you guide me Oh, spirit, spirit, stand by me Come on,
come on, come on Set me free, oh,spirit
Now that I've found my way home I've got to get there, get there Though one
step seems one mile long Your bridge before my face I will take the leap of
faith
Spirit, spirit, would you guide me Oh, spirit, spirit, stand by me Oh, spirit,
spirit, set me free Spirit, spirit, spirit, set me free
Help me find my way Stand by my side Spirit take my hand And be my guide
Run free, run free Run free, run free Run free, run free
