Baby, I'm so glad you're over here<br>
Now I get to show you all the things<br>
That I been wanting to show you for such a long time<br>
Don't say nuthin'<br>
<br>
Picture this you and me in the kitchen babe, on the counter<br>
Feeding each other fruits babe<br>
Straight from there walk into the bedroom babe<br>
I touch your hair and then you turn around and say what's on your mind<br>
And girl tonight we'll be making sweet love<br>
<br>
<i>[1]</i> - Girl tonight we'll make sweet love<br>
Until the rain comes falling down on you and me<br>
All of these things and etcetera etcetera etcetera<br>
Wanna kiss you places you want me to<br>
Promise girl that I'll do all of these things<br>
And etcetera etcetera etcetera<br>
<br>
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo<br>
Doing you pretty much all night long babe<br>
'Till I hear you screaming my name babe<br>
In the pool you and me skinny dippin darlin' Kelly's rules<br>
No playing hard to get now tell me what the deal cuz<br>
Girl tonight we'll be making sweet love<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
Put on some clothes and lets go to the IHOP, baby<br>
(Let's go to the IHOP babe)<br>
No, no, no (Baby we just made love)<br>
No matter how good the food may taste<br>
(No matter how the food may taste)<br>
I'm still thinking about your body baby, yes I am<br>
(It's your body I'm thinking of)<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1 until fade]</i>
