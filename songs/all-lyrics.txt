<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
Hey sis how you doing?<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
Fine, what's going on with you?<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
Oh nothing much<br>

<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
Got your message from earlier this afternoon<br>
And something just didn't sound right<br>
And so I'm calling you back to check on you<br>
How you holding up?<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
Oh everything is fine<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
You know I don't believe you<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
Whatcha saying? You think I'm lying?<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
I'm not saying it, but I know you<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
How you know me?<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
Cause you're my brother<br>
And therefore I can tell<br>
When something is troubling you<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
Ok Ok, I give you that<br>
Nothing's wrong, I take that back<br>
There is something on my mind<br>
But sis, I don't want to waste your time<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
But I done told you time and time again<br>
Whatever you're going through<br>
You can come and talk to me<br>
And I will say a prayer with you<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
But I done prayed and prayed night and day<br>
I still can't seem to find my way<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
Rob that ain't nothing but the devil telling you<br>
That you're washed up and you're through<br>
But sister's here to let you know<br>
Boy you're gonna make it through<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
Sister, do you really believe that I can rise again<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
Yes, and not only that, Rob, God will forgive you for your sins<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
Can you tell me what to do?<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
Well first you gotta believe the truth<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
Sometimes it's hard to believe in Him<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
That's okay because he believes in you<br>
<br>
The winds, the rain<br>
The storm<br>
The weapons that are formed against us (I will survive)<br>
The trying times<br>
The sleepless nights<br>
Just know that faith is with us (and I believe yeah)<br>
Through all of the hills<br>
And valleys roamed<br>
That we must come to (woah)<br>
Walk side by side<br>
Follow the light<br>
And we'll make it through (We'll make it through yeah)<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
So, so what you're saying is believe a little more?<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
Yes, cause faith is the key that will opens up the door<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
What you're saying to me, it's hard to receive<br>
Especially when trouble follows me<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
When we're keeping it real<br>
Robert sometimes<br>
Trouble can follow where you lead<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
Yes sister, I know sometimes, but I...<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
Just wait, let me make a phone call<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
To who?<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
A prayer buddy of mine<br>
She can help you tear down your walls<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
I don't want nobody in my business<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
She's a friend<br>
And besides you need this<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
You know how church folk can be<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
Boy I'm your sister, trust in me<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
Mmm<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
Now hold on<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
Maybe she's gone...<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
No<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
Maybe we ought to just try...<br>
<br>
<i>[Maurice Mahon:]</i><br>
Hello<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
Shh shh, hello, is Kim there?<br>
<br>
<i>[Maurice Mahon:]</i><br>
Yes, I think she's around here somewhere<br>
Hold on<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
Now you just let me do the talking<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
Mmm hmm<br>
<br>
<i>[Kim Burrell:]</i><br>
Hello?<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
Hey girl, how you doing?<br>
<br>
<i>[Kim Burrell:]</i><br>
Hey Kelly<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
My little brother's on the line and needed advice from you<br>
<br>
<i>[Kim Burrell:]</i><br>
Ooh what can I do for you?<br>
Hello?<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
Go ahead Rob, she's talking to you<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
Oh, well, I know you must be very busy<br>
So I'm not going to mess around, nah<br>
Just telling my sister how my life is upside down<br>
And I don't know whether I'm going left or right half the time<br>
Sometimes think I'm gonna lose my mind, you feel me?<br>
<br>
<i>[Kim Burrell:]</i><br>
Mmm hmm... similar to what I used to go through<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
Really?<br>
<br>
<i>[Kim Burrell:]</i><br>
Yes, and sometimes I still do<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
Yeah?<br>
<br>
<i>[Kim Burrell:]</i><br>
See it doesn't matter who you are<br>
Or where you're from<br>
If you struggle, God will use you<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
Amen sister, what you're saying is so true<br>
Rob are you there?<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
Yes, I'm just listening to the both of you<br>
It's so easy to say, but not so easy to do<br>
<br>
<i>[Kim Burrell:]</i><br>
Yes but if you stand the truth<br>
It will free you<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
Oh<br>
<br>
<i>[Kim Burrell:]</i><br>
Just stand strong<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
Stand strong<br>
<br>
<i>[Kim Burrell:]</i><br>
With your head held high<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
With your head held high<br>
<br>
<i>[Kim Burrell:]</i><br>
Said it wont be long<br>
In time he will provide<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
Will he?<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
Yes he will<br>
<br>
<i>[Kim Burrell:]</i><br>
You just stay in the race<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
Just stay in the race<br>
<br>
<i>[Kim Burrell:]</i><br>
And keep on running<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
And down to the end<br>
<br>
<i>[Kim and Kelly:]</i><br>
Cause your day is coming<br>
<br>
The winds, the rain<br>
The storm<br>
The weapons that are formed against us<br>
The trying times<br>
The sleepless nights<br>
Just know that faith is with us<br>
Through all of the hills<br>
And valleys roamed<br>
That we must come to<br>
Walk side by side<br>
Follow the light<br>
And we'll make it through<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
He'll give you peace<br>
In the midst of your storm<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
Sometimes I feel like it's too late for me<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
But he'll never leave you<br>
<br>
<i>[Kim Burrell:]</i><br>
No way<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
You just gotta hang on<br>
<br>
<i>[Kim Burrell:]</i><br>
Hang on<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
Robert say a prayer, keep your head<br>
God will do just what he said<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly:]</i><br>
Finally I think I get it<br>
<br>
<i>[Kelly Price:]</i><br>
Yes, that's it<br>
That's the spirit<br>
<br>
The winds, the rain<br>
The storm<br>
The weapons that are formed against us<br>
The trying times<br>
The sleepless nights<br>
Just know that faith is with us<br>
Through all of the hills<br>
And valleys roamed<br>
That we must come to<br>
Walk side by side<br>
Follow the light<br>
And we'll make it through<br>
The winds, the rain<br>
The storm<br>
The weapons that are formed against us<br>
The trying times<br>
The sleepless nights<br>
Just know that faith is with us<br>
Through all of the hills<br>
And valleys roamed<br>
That we must come to<br>
Walk side by side<br>
Follow the light<br>
And we'll make it through<br>
The winds, the rain<br>
The storm<br>
The weapons that are formed against us<br>
The trying times<br>
The sleepless nights<br>
Just know that faith is with us
Baby, we been knowing each other for a long, <br>
long time for somethin' like this to just go and break up everything. <br>
<br>
<i>[Verse 1:]</i><br>
Here we are, just sittin' here <br>

You know what I want <br>
And baby, I know what you need <br>
So stop hesitatin', girl <br>
And give your love to me. <br>

Just put this CD on the repeat <br>
And let me pamper you. <br>

<i>[Repeat Chorus]</i><br>

<i>[Verse 3:]</i><br>
Now the swimmin' pool's out back <br>
Come on and skinny dip, baby <br>
Eat breakfast in the morning <br>

In the middle of the night <br>
There's no need for morning here <br>
So hold your pillow tight <br>
Cuz I wanna do it again and again. <br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat Chorus]</i><br>

Take this love to you <br>
I will take care of all you need <br>
Baby, lets asure <br>
I just wanna set you free, free. <br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat Chorus til fade]</i>
As I look into my life <br>
Searching for that paradise<br>
<br>
Oh Lord will you help me, find me<br>
Take this crazy ghetto past of mine<br>
And put it all behind me<br>
Look down on the ghetto man<br>
And change his mission<br>
And put it in the hearts<br>
Of many to stop confusion<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
My sistas, brothas<br>
Let's put these hands together<br>
We need to stop chokin' on the truth<br>
And start smokin' on a plan man<br>
Love and respect that woman<br>
And bring her happiness<br>
I'm talkin' to the ghetto<br>
For each other we should help<br>
While our babies are dying in the street<br>
We've got to be saying to ourselves
My time, my patience, my love<br>
My blood, my sweat, my tears<br>
My burdens, my drama, my pain<br>
My car, my money, my home<br>

My shakin', my sleep, my stress<br>
My days, my night, my rest<br>
My do's, my don'ts, my dares<br>
And my church, my pastor, my prayers<br>
My all, my faith, my powers<br>
And my kitchen, my sink, my towels<br>
My joy, my sad, my hate<br>
And my sister, my cousin, my friends<br>

I been looking to see the truth as it unfolds<br>
Cuz I been around this globe and back <br>
Enough to know the fact<br>
Who loves me<br>
And who loves me not<br>
We be shit’s so hot<br>
You could put it in red tops<br>
And pump it through every hood, ghetto, and block<br>
Until they heart stops<br>
That’s why they fiend for me<br>
And I thank you for every blessing that you givin me lord<br>
And im grateful for all my talent and my vocal accords <br>
And all these hatas I keep shakin em off<br>
Rubbin they face in fame<br>
Im sorry I changed the game<br>
But its mine and I cant complain<br>
Rule and R Kelly<br>
Been around the world<br>

Bumpin n grindin these bitches<br>
But we always on time when a woman fed up<br>
And that’s love<br>
That’s why they all fuck wit us<br>

That’s how I live<br>
I had to get rid of a lotta fake homies<br>
Over the years<br>
You see me on tv sometimes<br>
Not how it is<br>
Yall gotta start learnin how to separate me from showbiz <br>
When im rollin through your city<br>
Show me love<br>
And ladies when you see a boy<br>
Give me love<br>
And though im not conceited (right)<br>
Its jus my space sometimes I need it (right)<br>
Said I got so many friends in them area codes<br>
That I hand out them tickets when it comes to my shows<br>
Ja lets break bread together<br>
Pray together<br>
That we grow strong together<br>
Its clear forever<br>
Help each other through the stormy weather<br>
Lets hurt together<br>
Lets cry together<br>
And even if we grow together<br>
Then together we'll make it better<br>

You and me, havin sex<br>
After an argument, that shit's the best<br>
You and me, havin sex yeahh<br>
After an argument, that shit's the best<br>
(Think about it while the streets you roam<br>
 It's Dom P and Army in the fridge when you get home)<br>
<br>
<i>[*overlapping R's last line]</i><br>
<br>
I storm in, she storm out<br>
It's like the "War of the Roses" goin on in my house<br>
It's a little seperation but I know how to fix the situation<br>
Mami just sufferin from love deprevation<br>
So I gotta give her thug reperations<br>
Put it in the life until love leg is shakin<br>
Slow and passionate, 'til we forget what happens<br>
Then we laughin and we back friends<br>
<br>
<i>[Interlude: R. Kelly]</i><br>
You don't have to fuss and fight<br>
Why don't you just spend the night<br>
Baby let's just kiss and hug<br>
You know the words girl let's make up<br>
So much love to be made<br>
Instead of screamin, "Who's to blame?"<br>
Girl I don't wanna.. let you go, I need you so<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
<br>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br>
Girlfriend didn't believe me when I said I'd be back in a little<br>
Cause I had the Chris T on with the crease in the middle<br>
Plus a fresh cut and the freezin icicles<br>
on my wrist, on my hand, that's when shit hit the fan<br>
Said, "You never spend timey, what's up with that?"<br>
Translated it means<br>
<i>[R]</i> Hit it hard from the back<br>
Yeah she hid my car keys<br>
And forced me to fall asleep to her heartbeat<br>

<i>[Chorus w/o Jay-Z]</i><br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br>
I don't want.. baby I don't want to fight<br>
I just wanna make it right (ooh yeah)<br>
Put out problems to the side<br>
Let's just make sweet love tonight (I don't want)<br>
Baby I don't want to fight<br>
I just wanna make it right (ohhhhh love)<br>
Put our problems to the side<br>
Let's just make sweet love tonight<br>
<br>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br>
Sex so intense, all that's on my mind<br>
It ain't feel this good since the very first time<br>
I'm pullin her close, she's pullin away<br>
I'm tryin to kiss her mouth but she keeps turnin her face<br>
Cute sex game like our very first date<br>
We ain't know each other well enough, we had to wait<br>
But oh!  I know just where your hot spot at<br>
You can not deny that, so do not try that<br>
I do not buy that..<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus w/o Jay-Z]</i><br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus w/o Jay-Z (fades out)]</i>
My mind is telling me no but my body my body's telling me yes<br>
I (baby) don't want to hurt nobody<br>
But there is something that I must confess........... (chill)<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus: repeat 4x]</i><br>
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind<br>
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind<br>
<br>
See I know just what you want and I know just what you need girl<br>
So baby bring your body to me (bring your body here)<br>
I'm not fooling around with you baby<br>
My love is true (with you) with you is where I want to be, girl see<br>
you need someone someone like me to satisfy your every needs<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus 4x]</i><br>
<br>
You say he's not treating you right<br>
Then lady spend the night now<br>
I'll love you like you need to be love (girl why don't you try some of me)<br>
No need to look no more because I've opened up my door<br>
You'll never feel another love you see<br>
you need someone, someone like me girl to make love to you baby constantly<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus 4x]</i>
When I discovered you I discovered a piece within, joy like no other,<br>
you're my closest friend,<br>
if you were a number you'd be a perfect 10<br>
right out of the skies you were heaven sent.<br>
the way we make love over and over again<br>
if I had to describe you I wouldn't know where to begin<br>
I am so proud to be your next of kin<br>
you prayed over me when I had no reason to live<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br>
candy caramel coated taffies chocolate covered strawberries,<br>
love so sweet, your my chocolate factory<br>
gum drops mixed with chocolate milk bars, theres so much variety<br>
love so sweet, your my chocolate factory<br>
<br>
now if I could write a book on how you make me feel<br>
the tittle would be strong black man, and that's for real<br>
you got me going round and round like a ferries wheel<br>
in and out of relationships and baby your the deal,<br>
ain't nobody on god's green earth for me, heaven stirred us up together<br>
and made the perfect chemistry, wouldn't change you for the world as long as I exist.<br>
Always in the kitchen cooking my favorite meal.<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus x3]</i>
Entrea<br>
Ay, tantas cosas que quiero<br>
Decirte yo quiero <br>
Hacer por ti<br>
But first we must dancce<br>
<br>
Private cotillion style<br>
One lady's fantasy <br>
Trip to Milan tonight <br>
Exclusive shopping spree<br>
Mansions await, your scent <br>
That smells just like treasure <br>
Dining with me in suites<br>
That overlooks the shore<br>
<br>
<i>[1]</i> - As we move, then we touch, then we dip<br>
(Dancin' with a rich man)<br>
As we move, then we touch, then we dip<br>
(Shall we dance, shall we dance, shall we dance)<br>
As we turn, then we stare, then we kiss<br>
(Dancin' with a rich man)<br>
As we turn, then we stare, then we kiss<br>
<br>
Kissing the feet of you<br>
While listening to Bonsois<br>
And your angelic brace<br>
Wearing Victoria <br>
Passionate love with you <br>
Hearing you "Oh, oui oui" <br>
Some antique jewelry from<br>
Kenshire's gallery <br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
And when you elevate<br>
Like visions of grandeur<br>
Mademoiselle and me<br>
Behind the villa doors<br>
Sunsets on yellow sand <br>
That's where we rendezvous<br>
Chapels of Valentine<br>
Is just to name a few<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i>
<i>[1]</i> - Did you ever think that you would be this rich<br>
Did you ever think that you would have these hits<br>
Did you ever think that you would be the don<br>
Have a crib with a fifty acre lawn<br>
<br>
Did you ever think that you would be this paid<br>
Were there times when your ass was real afraid<br>
Did you ever think that you would sell out tours<br>
Have a show with fifty million viewers<br>
<br>
I used to think about how I was gonna make it<br>
Struggling day to day just trying to get this paper<br>
Hoping the day would come when things would go my way<br>
But now I'm living lavish and all I do is hear them say<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
Now I've been around the world and seen so many things<br>
Partied in every club nothing but VIP<br>
I never take for granted these luxuries I have<br>
Just try my best to answer all of these questions that I ask<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
I used to play the game, at night the same old same<br>
Dreamin' about city lights it was my only lie<br>
And now it's world wide shows<br>
As if I can fly on over <br>
Now I can't go nowhere without the whole world due to know<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>

I used to dream about this life<br>
Now I'm sitting on first class flights<br>

Sportin' nothing but the rocks, navigators on the block<br>

Niggas in the lot jammin' to the knock<br>

How could something so right go so wrong<br>
Just coming in on flight 412<br>
But she was listening on the phone<br>
I thought I had it all together<br>
But I was wrong obviously<br>
Cuz what was once done in the dark<br>
Came to light eventually<br>

I don't believe the shit I did the night we were at your mom's<br>
I got a page from out of town, lied and said it was my job<br>
Grabbed my hat, coat, gloves and scarf<br>
I told you that I would return<br>
But by the look upon your face you had already discerned<br>
You pulled me to the side and you begged for me to stay<br>
But I was caught up in a life that forced me to walk away<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
Okay you, you're saying you came in and<br>
And these two women they, they poured<br>
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, it wasn't nothing like that<br>
All I know is uh, I was asleep, they came in<br>
Woke me up pourin' hot grits<br>
And all kinds of shit on me man, okay beatin' me and shit<br>
Hittin' me with all sorts of type shit (Damn)<br>
<br>
With a cigar in my mouth over Vegas city lights<br>
On a path way up the hill to be with my other wife<br>
A rich nigga living strife going on like nothing's wrong<br>
But that damn Caller ID is the reason for this song<br>
So one called up the other while I was out playing some golf<br>
Talking about my doggish ways and how I need to be droppped off<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>

Now go ahead, shoot me now because I'm guilty as sin<br>
Playin' Russian roulette with hearts not to mention the kids<br>

Out smoking with friends as I reminisced<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
I can't take it no more I've got to confess<br>
See now, I don't know why<br>
I thought that I could keep creeping<br>
Cuz you see what goes around<br>
Comes back on around and back on around<br>
And back on around again, yes it does<br>
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh <br>
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh<br>
In a state of shock that's what it left me<br>
Take it from a man who knows<br>
That three ain't company<br>
No, no, no that's what I kept telling myself<br>
Now I done lost the houses the kids and the dogs<br>
Now I'm sleeping in my momma's house<br>
And even she says, your sorry ass don't deserve no help<br>
Must be because of what my old man did to her<br>
Niggas<br>
Rockland
So amazing, unbelievacle, miraculous women you are.<br>
Incredible, unforgetable, your the worlds greatest by far.<br>
Sensational, so lovable, my cinderella you are.<br>
So beautiful, ghetto fablous, the reason i wish upon a star.<br>
As i lay me down to sleep i, pray your heart ill always keep it.<br>
Hope you feel the same.<br>
So baby come and hop on board my life and,<br>
Just let love take us away.<br>

Everything my team must to do one thing<br>
You're the meanest queen on the scene<br>
Make a player 'fien and be havin' dreams<br>
For real, it's real as it seems<br>
You bring the trees, I'll bring the B's<br>
<br>
Begin to freeze on to me, you can scream to please<br>
Plus I'm ready now, take a stand, got me on Rockland<br>
I can be your freaky man, you can climb in, suck a 10<br>
Want some ends? You outta there<br>
No more funny face, put you in your place<br>
Come be the dinner, I'm a bring a plate<br>

She's my ghetto girl in her own world, she's a queen<br>
Queen of all things, for that I mean she's Spring<br>
Personality rings bells in my dreams<br>
Night to dawn, light spread tight, let's swing<br>
Grip it in motion, wet coastin' with a little bit of ridin' rough<br>
Up and down we stroke, strokin' puttin' things in her pocket is fat<br>
But watch her stay cool, calm and collected<br>
Flexin', check it, never was on that stressin'<br>
Cuz she bring that hay for the day, what a blessin'<br>

We be like this, gettin' high<br>
Ghetto queen you look so delightin'<br>
Heard your body callin', callin' me, baby <br>
Tellin' me to rodeo ride it<br>
Don't fall off, hold on<br>
Get your roll on, step aside, hugged her back<br>
She swore she wouldn't do me, need your loyalty<br>
You're makin' me wantin' to snap<br>
I know your man is mad as hell<br>
Cuz it to a player and I did it well<br>
And I added one more for the road, to let 'em know<br>

Lovin' how you sound when we get 'em off<br>

Rodeo show, duckin' you, buckin' in the back of a Cadillac<br>
Tell me if you want it like that (let's bang)<br>
Got me tweakin' Mary Jane, it's a hay thang<br>

<i>[Verse 1: Jay-Z]</i><br>
Lord forgive me I'm ballin' out of control<br>
Got the spirit of a hustler pouring out of my soul<br>
Mami I love you but ain't no stopping my stroll<br>
If you wanna be down with me you gotta rooolll<br>
Like a roll and if my side of the bed gets cold<br>
You gotta know that I'm out chasin' doooough<br>
I'm ain't stunting these hoes<br>
Stunting my growth if I fuck 'em I'm fleeing them<br>
I need something to hold<br>
Then I'm home to you<br>
I might roam like a cellular phone<br>
But I never leave you alone I<br>
Solemnly swear, I was married to the block before I met you<br>
It's still a part of me there but I<br>
Solemnly swear, I try but it's in my blood<br>
Pumping yay since I was yay high<br>
I'm in love with the life<br>
So except me for the bastard that I am<br>
You're still in love with me right?<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus: R. Kelly]</i><br>
Baby I can't figure it out<br>
Said you pussy tastes like honey<br>
But I can't stop huggin' the block<br>
All night tryna get this money<br>
<br>
Stuck between these two worlds<br>
What I'm gonna do with both these girls<br>
Two main squeezes in separate cities<br>
Both found out man, shit ain't pretty<br>
Stuck between these two worlds<br>
What I'm gonna do with both these girls<br>
Hard to choose between her and these streets<br>
Cuz the game keeps calling me<br>
<br>
<i>[Verse 2: Jay-Z]</i><br>
Baby girl had me off my grind, off my clock<br>
I would often find I was off my block<br>
Couldn't keep her off my mind, my balls were shot<br>
They never thought that a pause or stop<br>
Was in my pores to push rock raw<br>
Take a lost rebound like Bo Outlaw, I'm so outlaw<br>
Got a hunger for this game, but keep that on the low<br>
Like a one against the grain<br>
Got the sun against my brain<br>
A girl in my ear<br>
I like her for her<br>
I'm a dig into this shit, I like it like I like her<br>
Sometimes I can't figure it out<br>
I'm in love with the life but she's sticking it out<br>
She know wanna hug kisses keep a nigga in the house<br>
Lock down while his niggas is out (out)<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus X2]</i>
You made the sun,<br>
You made the moon,<br>
Gave seasons change,<br>
Woah<br>
You made the clouds,<br>
You put the rainbow after rain<br>
Woah<br>
Created time,<br>
Now this ones mine,<br>
Gave pictures frames,<br>
Woah<br>
Created man gave him woman,<br>
Why did you do that for me?<br>
<br>
These are the questions asked  before i lay me down and go to sleep, (ooh sometimes i wonder)<br>
Sometimes i wonder why you decided to keep you hands on me.<br>
Of all the miracles, signs and wonders,<br>
There's still one mystery,<br>
How did you manage to love me?<br>
<br>
You breathed the life right into me,<br>
Then made my heart beat,<br>
Woah<br>
Created the mountains,<br>
And all of the deep seas,<br>
Flowers in the trees,<br>
Woah<br>
You made tommorrow come again,<br>
You calmed the strong winds,<br>
Woah<br>
And after all I've done,<br>
Gave me a son,<br>
Tell me why would you do that for me?<br>
<br>
These are the questions asked  before i lay me down and go to sleep,<br>
(Right in the middle of my prayers)<br>
Sometimes i wonder why you decided to keep you hands on me.<br>
Of all the miracles, signs and wonders,<br>
There's still one mystery,<br>
How did you manage to love me? (how did you manage that?)<br>
How did you manage to love me?<br>
<br>
Said I've got to know how (how did you manage to love?)<br>
After all that i have done, oh Lord<br>
How? (how did you manage to love?)<br>
How could i have been so bad, oh Lord<br>
How? (how did you manage to forgive me?)<br>
Even when i didnt believe in me you believed in me Lord.<br>
How? (how did you manage to forgive me?)<br>
Jesus you sacrificed your dear life for me.<br>
(How did you manage to forgive me?)<br>
Ooooh Lord tell me (why did the pain uprise for me)

<i>[Chorus]</i>
I used to think that I could not go on<br>
And life was nothing but an awful song<br>
But now I know the meaning of true love<br>
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms<br>
<br>
If I can see it, then I can do it<br>
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br>
I believe I can fly<br>
I believe I can touch the sky<br>
I think about it every night and day<br>
Spread my wings and fly away<br>
I believe I can soar<br>
I see me running through that open door<br>
I believe I can fly<br>
I believe I can fly<br>
I believe I can fly<br>
<br>
See I was on the verge of breaking down<br>
Sometimes silence can seem so loud<br>
There are miracles in life I must achieve<br>
But first I know it starts inside of me, oh<br>
<br>
If I can see it, then I can be it<br>
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
<br>
Hey, cause I believe in me, oh<br>
<br>
If I can see it, then I can be it<br>
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
<br>
Hey, if I just spread my wings<br>
I can fly<br>
I can fly<br>
I can fly, hey<br>
If I just spread my wings<br>
I can fly<br>
Fly-eye-eye
I used to think that I could not go on<br>
And life was nothing but an awful song<br>
But now I know the meaning of true love<br>
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms<br>
<br>
If I can see it, then I can do it<br>
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br>
I believe I can fly<br>
I believe I can touch the sky<br>
I think about it every night and day<br>
Spread my wings and fly away<br>
I believe I can soar<br>
I see me running through that open door<br>
I believe I can fly<br>
I believe I can fly<br>
I believe I can fly<br>
<br>
See I was on the verge of breaking down<br>
Sometimes silence can seem so loud<br>
There are miracles in life I must achieve<br>
But first I know it starts inside of me, oh<br>
<br>
If I can see it, then I can be it<br>
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
<br>
Hey, cause I believe in me, oh<br>
<br>
If I can see it, then I can be it<br>
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
<br>
Hey, if I just spread my wings<br>
I can fly<br>
I can fly<br>
I can fly, hey<br>
If I just spread my wings<br>
I can fly<br>
Fly-eye-eye
Girl I must have been crazy <br>
To say that it was over<br>
I had to be a fool <br>
To yell out we were through<br>
And now I'm all alone <br>
And feeling down and out baby<br>
When I never <br>
Meant for this to end<br>
It was so so crazy of me<br>
Sometimes we say things that we really don't mean<br>
Well I'm sorry baby<br>
Bring your lovin' back to me<br>
<br>
<i>[1]</i> - I can't sleep babe<br>
I can't think babe<br>
I can't live babe<br>
Without you in my life <br>
I can't go on babe<br>
This is my song baby<br>
Don't wanna do nothin' if I go away baby<br>
And I can't do nothin' if you're not around<br>
<br>
Though I must admit <br>
That things got out of hand<br>
When you told me<br>
That he was just a friend<br>
I should of had my trust in you <br>
From the very start darlin'<br>
Cuz I never meant for this to end<br>
How can we get it back again?<br>
Oh sometimes a man can say things <br>
That he really don't mean<br>
Well I'm sorry baby <br>
Bring your lovin' back to me<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
Baby can we meet somewhere <br>
And talk about it<br>
Oh baby, can we work it out<br>
I'm not gonna let you go my baby <br>
Before I let you know that I<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1 until fade]</i>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
I decided to stay home tonite<br>
I decided I'ma treat you right<br>
I decided to be there for you<br>
Decided to be on my P's and Q's<br>
I decided to give up my friends<br>
Decided I'ma take you out weekends<br>
Decided to give you a reason to trust<br>
These are decisions that I make for love<br>
<br>
<i>[Verse 1]</i><br>
Enough is enough no more running around<br>
(Searchin' for what's right here at home)<br>
Because my luck is 'bout to turn around<br>
(And I just can't keep doin' you wrong)<br>
Girl I take it for granted that you will be here always<br>
(Tired of this ego trip)<br>
'Cause soon you'll be searchin' for another man<br>
And I just can't have that happen to me<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
<br>
<i>[Verse 2]</i><br>
<br>
Now I've had about all that I can stand no more<br>
(I'm turnin' in my playa's card)<br>
See I'm retirin' from the secret life I chose<br>
(Cause I just can't keep breakin' your heart)<br>
It was silly of me to be the way that I was<br>
(First was blind, but now I see)<br>
Baby, soon you'll be sayin' I'm fallin' out of love<br>
And I just can't let it happen whoa whoa I<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
<br>
<i>[Bridge]</i><br>
<br>
When tha morning comes, you see the sun will shine on you and me<br>
Was on my way to losin' you, until' I found reality<br>
So cast away your doubts and fears, cause from now on I'll be right here<br>
For always<br>
Forever more, I decided<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus & Bridge 2]</i><br>
<br>
Girl I'm going to dump my friends<br>
Yes I will<br>
Truly I will<br>
We are going to be together on the weekend<br>
Whoa, whoa<br>
See these are the decisions I made for love<br>
For the two of us<br>
Get up off this bull and rebuild your trust<br>
Yeah, yeah, oh noooooo, whoa<br>
There will be<br>
No more cheatin'<br>
No more creepin'<br>
No more fuckin'<br>
No more sneakin'
Baby, oh baby<br>
I know we had an argument and all<br>
Ooh babe<br>
And I must have said some pretty foul shit but<br>
Mmm, mmm<br>
I just want you to know that I ain't mean none of that<br>
Baby, baby<br>
None of it<br>
<br>
Now I was supposed to be a man about it<br>
Shoulda never left your side<br>
No way, no how<br>
Put too many years in this relationship<br>
And it's not that serious for us to split<br>
Now I admit sometimes I make mistakes<br>
But still I appreciate the love we make<br>
Stop at the door and put your bags back down<br>
Now baby please can we work this out<br>
<br>
Now I might say you can walk<br>
(But I don't mean it)<br>
And I might name call<br>
(I don't mean it)<br>
I may pull some silly stunts<br>
(Uhm mmm)<br>
But that's just a front, I don't mean it<br>
(Now wait a minute hear me out)<br>
Now I may holler at you<br>
(I don't mean it)<br>
And I may tell you we're through<br>
(But I don't mean it, no, no)<br>
May give you looks that can kill<br>
(Can kill)<br>
But it's not for real<br>
(Not for real)<br>
I don't mean it<br>
(I don't mean it hey)<br>
<br>
Now I was supposed to be more understanding<br>
Instead of tryin to be so damn demandin<br>
Baby I'm willing to drop my ego<br>
And do the things I should have done and more<br>
See I know that I can be a better man<br>
Girl all you gotta do is take my hand<br>
Promise me this time<br>
I'm goin all the way<br>
And show you all the reasons why you stayed<br>
<br>
Now I might say you can walk<br>
(But I don't mean it, no, no)<br>
And I might name call<br>
(Girl I don't mean it)<br>

And I may tell you we're through<br>
(Girl you should know, I don't mean it)<br>
May give you looks that can kill<br>
(Um mmm)<br>
But it's not for real<br>
I don't mean it<br>
(Come here girl)<br>
<br>
See I never meant<br>
To break you down<br>
And make you cry, make you cry<br>
Oh please baby please<br>
Turn back around<br>
Don't you say goodbye, say goodbye<br>
Sometimes I know that<br>
I can take it<br>
Just a little bit too far<br>
But yo my heart is good<br>
Heart is good<br>
So baby you don't have to worry<br>
You're gonna see a change<br>
Girl you know I love ya<br>
Even though I may say<br>

Now I might say you can walk<br>

And I might name call<br>

Now I may holler at you<br>
(When I'm hollerin' at you)<br>
And I may tell you we're through<br>
(I never mean it when I say we're through)<br>
May give you looks that can kill<br>

Happy People baby
How did I ever let you slip away<br>
Never knowing I'd be singing this song some day<br>
And now I'm sinking, sinking to rise no more<br>
Ever since you closed the door<br>

<i>[1]</i> - If I could turn, turn back the hands of time<br>
Then my darlin' you'd still be mine<br>
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time<br>
Then darlin' you, you'd still be mine<br>
<br>
Funny, funny how time goes by<br>
And blessings are missed in the wink of an eye<br>
Why oh why oh why should one have to go on suffering<br>
When every day I pray please come back to me<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
And you had enough love for the both of us<br>
But I, I, I did you wrong, I admit I did<br>
But now I'm facing the rest of my life alone, whoa<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>

I'd never hurt you (If I could turn back)<br>
Never do you wrong (If I could turn back)<br>
And never leave your side (If I could turn back)<br>
If I could turn back the hands<br>
<br>
There'd be nothing I wouldn't do for you <br>
(If I could turn back)<br>
Forever honest and true to you<br>
(If I could turn back)<br>
If you accept me back in your heart, I love you<br>

(If I could turn back)<br>
That would be my will<br>

Darlin' I'm begging you to take me by the hands<br>

I'm going down, yes I am <br>

Down on my bended knee, yeah<br>
(If I could turn back)<br>
And I'm gonna be right there until you return to me<br>
(If I could turn back the hands)<br>
<br>
(If I could turn back)<br>
If I could just turn back that little clock on the wall<br>
(If I could turn back)<br>
Then I'd come to realize how much I love you <br>
Love you love you love you<br>
(If I could turn back the hands)
I don't understand<br>
I do all this for you<br>
You contemplating on me<br>
Or is it him <br>
Or is it me<br>
Or is it him<br>
He told you he'd be there for you <br>
And he wasn't<br>
I told you I'd be there for you<br>
And I was<br>
And still is the real is <br>
Who takes care of biz<br>
Took you from apartments<br>
And got you home like The Wiz<br>
I'm not the kind of guy <br>
To give you everything<br>
But if you're real then<br>
You can get some ice in your rings<br>
You and me straight to the crib<br>
Off the tour bus<br>
Spottin' my eyes, fireplace, big as us<br>
It really don't matter<br>
Who's first in the shower<br>
Fruit platter from a young maid every hour<br>
And when it comes down to the dollar<br>
You can have it<br>
All ya gotta do is keep it hoppin' like a rabbit<br>
Friends come around don't be ready to change<br>
Treat me like a stepchild when I';m up on my game<br>
Remember I'm the first to give your cootie the pain<br>
So I wanna hear you answer when I ask you my name<br>
<br>
Ooh baby, I want you here with me<br>
And give you everything <br>
That your heart desires<br>
Lady can you feel me <br>
Do you wanna be with me for always<br>
Baby can't you see <br>
What you do to me<br>

And who picked you up when that nigga put you down<br>
Restraining orders keep that fool from around<br>
Had to set you up in a spot downtown<br>
See I was the one who was there for you<br>
But I'm not the one that's gonna play the two<br>
Channel bags in the trunk what you gon' do<br>
You could treat the future like a menu<br>
As long as I'm the only one to bend you<br>
And when you wanna take a flight I'm the one to send you<br>
Never be the one that's out to hurt you<br>
Tell you that I'm there and then desert you<br>

<i>[Intro]</i><br>
Yeah, like I was saying<br>

I'm not tryin' to say things to hurt you<br>
You know what I'm saying<br>
I don't wanna hurt you, baby<br>
Just sometimes you do things <br>
That push me to say things I don't wanna say<br>
You know what I'm saying?<br>
You know I love you<br>
You know I care about you<br>
This time, you just brought it on yourself<br>
Yo, check it out<br>
<br>
Now I shoulda been more man<br>
About the way things went down<br>
Especially since we been dealin' <br>
For like seven years now<br>
I've been slowly, slowly bringing you down<br>
No conversation, no good sex in a while<br>
But still you search and find a way<br>
To love me somehow<br>
Even though I ride, you still trust me somehow<br>
Got my faces, some ice and a tie<br>
Slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly goin' down<br>
<br>
(I don't mean it) When I hollar at you <br>
(I don't mean it) When I say that we're through <br>
(I don't mean it) What I'm takin' you through <br>
(I don't mean it) Baby <br>
(I don't mean it) Said I'm sorry <br>
(I don't mean it) Can you find a way to forgive me<br>
(I don't mean it) Said I went to church this morning <br>
(I don't mean it) I don't mean it<br>
<br>
Running around here talking about <br>
How I'm a big player now<br>
Hidden in corners, blinging out our share<br>
Kelly makin' hits now<br>
Thinking about this industry <br>
And how I put it out<br>
You were there for me <br>
When I used dish rags for ties<br>
There's times that I didn't hear you<br>
I was talkin' too loud<br>
When I didn't come home<br>
I was hanging with the crowd<br>
Whenever we fight I try to win every round<br>
Can you find a way to forgive me now<br>
<br>
(I don't mean it) Cuz I don't mean it<br>
(I don't mean it) When I hollar at you<br>
(I don't mean it) Whenever I say we're through<br>
(I don't mean it) Whoa<br>
(I don't mean it) Can you find a way to forgive<br>
(I don't mean it) Ooh baby, I<br>
(I don't mean it) I went to church this mornin'<br>
(I don't mean it) Ooh I don't mean it<br>
<br>
<i>[R.]</i> Father, can you help me?<br>
<i>[Priest]</i>What do you need from me?<br>
<i>[R.]</i> I broke up with my girl and I'm feelin' kinda lonely<br>
<i>[Priest]</i>I been watching you from Heaven, Kelly<br>
You been so demanding<br>
You need to read my word, son<br>
And get some understanding<br>
<i>[R.]</i> But I been busy with my music<br>
<i>[Priest]</i>Stop making excuses<br>
Recognize the love she gives<br>
And try not to abuse it<br>
<i>[R.]</i> Is it too late to get her back?<br>
<i>[Priest]</i>Not as long as I'm a fact<br>
<i>[R.]</i> Well father, show me a sign<br>
That will make her mine<br>
<br>
(I don't mean it) I don't mean it<br>
(I don't mean it) Whenever I say we're through<br>
(I don't mean it) Or whenever I hollar at you<br>
(I don't mean it) Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh<br>
(I don't mean it) Ooh baby, ooh baby<br>

(I don't mean it) Whoa<br>
(I don't mean it) Whoa you should know I don't mean it<br>
(I don't mean it) I put it on my life<br>
(I don't mean it) Believe me I pay the price<br>
(I don't mean it) When I was down and out<br>
(I don't mean it) You reached out your hand<br>
(I don't mean it) I've learned it takes a good woman<br>
(I don't mean it) To raise a man<br>
(I don't mean it) Oh, I love you baby<br>
(I don't mean it) Oh oh oh I love you baby
<i>[Celine]</i><br>
No mountain's too high for you to climb<br>
All you have to do is have some climbing faith, oh yeah<br>
No river's too wide for you to make it across<br>
All you have to do is believe it when you pray<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br>
And then you will see the morning will come<br>
And every day will be bright as the sun<br>
All of your fears cast them on me<br>
I just want you to see<br>
<br>
<i>[Both]</i><br>
<i>[1]</i> - I'll be your cloud up in the sky<br>
I'll be your shoulder when you cry<br>
I hear your voices when you call me<br>
I am your angel<br>
<br>
And when all hope is gone, I'm here<br>
No matter how far you are, I'm near<br>
It makes no difference who you are<br>
I am your angel<br>
I'm your angel<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br>
I saw your teardrops and I heard you cry<br>
All you need is time<br>
Seek me and you shall find<br>
You have everything and you're still lonely<br>
It don't have to be this way<br>
Let me show you a better day<br>
<br>
<i>[Celine]</i><br>
And then you will see the morning will come<br>
And all of your days will be bright as the sun<br>
So all of your fears just cast them on me<br>
How can I make you see?<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
<i>[R ]</i> And when it's time to face the storm<br>
<i>[Celine]</i> I'll be right by your side<br>
<i>[R ]</i> Grace will keep us safe and warm<br>
<i>[Celine]</i> And I know we will survive<br>
And when it seems as if your end is drawing near<br>
<i>[R ]</i> (The end is drawing near)<br>
<i>[Celine]</i> Don't you dare give up the fight <br>
<i>[R ]</i> (Oh no)<br>
<i>[Celine]</i> Just put your trust beyond the skies<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1 until fade]</i>
Yeah I know, y'know, what a calling is<br>
I mean we all have a calling in our life, I believe<br>
You know I'm from the dirt man<br>
I come up in these streets, went without eatin', you know what I'm sayin'?<br>
Saw my Mom go without eatin'<br>
I got tired of that I had to go out there<br>
In them streets and hustle, you know?<br>
I mean you know what I'm sayin'?<br>
I mean it's easy for y'all to say, y'know (I surrender)<br>
Surrender your life, you know what I'm sayin'? (I surrender)<br>
Give your life to God and all that<br>
Y'know, that's good and I believe in God (I surrender to you Lord)<br>
But when you got bills at your front door all the time<br>
You know what I'm sayin'?<br>
Kids screamin' "Daddy, Momma, where the food at?" (I surrender)<br>
Man it makes it kinda hard to believe in (I surrender)<br>
Y'know, and have faith in something that you can't see (I surrender to your Lord)<br>
Even though you wanna believe<br>
Y'all just gonna have to just pray for me<br>
You know what I'm sayin'? 'Cause uh...<br>
<br>
Constantly my mind and my heart is racing (yeah)<br>
All by myself trying to solve all these problems I'm facing (oh yeah)<br>
Looking to man trying to find hope (uh-huh)<br>
But man will never know the depth of my struggles (oh)<br>
I was depending on myself (on myself)<br>
To give myself a hand (wow but)<br>
But when depending on myself (I...)<br>
Fell time again (that's why)<br>
And that's why I'm standing here alone (all alone)<br>
With no one else<br>
Lord I realised that I can't fight these battles by myself<br>

But everything I seemed to try just made it worse (ohh)<br>
And every road that I'd go down there were no signs (signs)<br>
Destination lonely with no peace of mind (yeah, ohh)<br>
I was depending on myself (on myself)<br>
To give myself a hand (but when)<br>
But when depending on myself (I would fell time and time again)<br>
Fell time again (that's why)<br>
And that's why I'm standing here alone (standing all alone)<br>
With no one else<br>
Lord I realised that I can't fight these battles by myself<br>
I surrender<br>

(There's no where for me to go)<br>
Joy I have tried to find (whoo)<br>

Said you walked throughout the building<br>
So come and rescue me from this hell<br>
'Cause I can't do it by myself (I can't do it... by myself)<br>

<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br>
Man, they go and tell me like<br>
you never know who your true friends until you ah umm<br>
both got a little bit of money<br>
I mean cause y'all both broke<br>
then there's no strain on the relationship, y'all both broke<br>
And if you got money and he ain't got no paper<br>
He still needs you so you'll never know how he really feel about you<br>
When y'all both get some paper, you'll see<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly + (Jay-Z)]</i><br>
We used to get money together, phone honies together<br>
Pushin chromed out twinkies in custom coach leather<br>
You claim it's all love, but nigga it's whatever<br>
Cause this is business, it ain't personal<br>
Same dream, same team, same schemes (mm)<br>
We even sold to the same damn fiends (how real is dat?)<br>
Ain't no rules in this war for this green<br>
This is business, and it ain't personal<br>
<br>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br>
Look, I'm a grown man dog<br>
And I ain't got time to be runnin behind y'all<br>
I know when I first started it was crazy to y'all<br>
"He's gon' start his own label, he'll never be able"<br>
Well, nigga you've been wrong before<br>
And you'll be wrong again if you bet against him<br>
We move through the hood like identical twins<br>
But it just so happen that a nigga made it rappin<br>
You showed your true colors, y'all niggaz stay yappin<br>
That don't stop him, a nigga weigh platinum<br>
Stop through the hood, to say what's happenin? (sup nigga)<br>
Fake hugz (uh-huh) fake whassup<br>
Fake love, fake fuck, fake thugs<br>
Gotta one myself for your fake shit, I raise up<br>
Hop in my wheels and I peel, streets are blazed up (uh-huh)<br>
About my bid'ness dog, y'all need to stay up - one<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus: R. Kelly]</i><br>
We used to get money together, phone honies together<br>
Pushin chromed out twinkies in custom coach leather<br>
You claim it's all love, but nigga it's whatever<br>
Cause this is business, it ain't personal<br>

Ain't no rules in this war for this green<br>

<br>
<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br>
I wish, I wish - that success, we could all<br>
get a piece of it (word) but that ain't real dog (no)<br>
Cause in these streets it's war, the industry much more<br>
But rich or poor, I'ma keep it real my nigga<br>
Invest in chips and watch my money hill get bigger<br>
And do things like, pull up to some clubs<br>
in the skirts with Jigga, and yellin out HEY!<br>
What the fuck, pop that Cris' my nigga<br>
And then he wants to know how many chips I done sold<br>
Well it ain't y'all business what's behind my doors<br>
But y'all niggaz don't appreciate shit<br>
Helped you out and you still actin like a little bitch<br>
Then you wonder why I put yo' ass in the tenth row<br>
when you asked me for some tickets to my TP-2 show<br>
Lawwwwwwd tell me, why we don't like to see us grow<br>

A-Alike (uh-huh) be alike (that's right)<br>
We don't vibe no more because we don't C/see alike<br>
And your mom got it twisted, she think Hov' changed<br>
Nope; Hov's still here like Rogaine<br>
Ask your boy what he did to the Hov' game<br>
How he jeapordized the whole game<br>
Now when we see each other it's so strange<br>
I don't know whether to hug him or slug him (damn)<br>
I don't know whether to cap him or dap him<br>
I don't know what to think of him, I don't know what's happenin<br>
But what I do know, all the niggaz that you know<br>
locked up doin a few doe, but who knows?<br>
Maybe it wasn't you, maybe I'm buggin too (right)<br>
But I'm scared dog, I don't know what the fuck to do<br>
Do me a favor, place yourself in my shoes<br>
The game, no exceptions, gotta follow the rules<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i>

I wish, I wish, I wish<br>
To every city<br>
I wish, I wish, I wish<br>
Every hood<br>
I wish, I wish, I wish<br>
And every block<br>
I wish, I wish, I wish<br>
Ghetto America!<br>
<br>
Rollin' through the hood<br>
Just stopped by to say what's up<br>
And let you know<br>
That your baby boy ain't doing so tough<br>
And even though you passed<br>
Going on four long years<br>
Still waking up late at night crying tears<br>
Just thinking about those days<br>
You used to talk to me<br>
Smilin' while I'm sippin' on this Hennesy<br>
And remember we bragged on how rich we would be<br>
To get up out this hood was like a fantasy<br>
<br>
<i>[1]</i><br>
And now you hear my songs the radio is playin'<br>
Oh I can't believe my ears<br>
And what everybody's sayin'<br>
And boy I'll tell you<br>
Folks don't know the half<br>
I would give it all up<br>
Just to take one ride<br>
<br>
(With you)<br>
How I used to kick it on the front porch<br>
(With you)<br>
And how I used to lay back and smoke weed<br>
(With you)<br>
And all the little basement party joints we'd do<br>
Now I'm just missing you<br>
How I wish<br>
<br>
<i>[2]</i><br>
I wish that I could hold you now<br>
I wish that I could touch you now<br>
I wish that I could talk to you<br>
Be with you somehow<br>
I know you're in a better place<br>
Even though I can't see your face<br>
I know you're smiling down on me<br>
Saying everything's okay<br>
And if I make it out this thug life<br>
I'll see you again someday<br>
I wish, I wish, I wish<br>
I wish, I wish, I wish<br>
<br>
Now ever since this money come<br>
Been nothing but stress<br>
Sometimes I wish I could trade in my success<br>
Y'all look at me and say boy you've been blessed<br>
But y'all don't see the inside of my unhappiness<br>
Man I swear this shit gets heavy like a ton<br>
That's why you hear me shootin'<br>
This real shit off like a gun<br>
Hmm I wonder how my friends would treat me now<br>
If I wasn't iced up with a Bentley and a house<br>
That's why fake ass niggas get fake ass digits<br>
And fake ass players get a real player hatin' 'em<br>
Honey Love goes platinum and y'all ass come around<br>
But y'all don't wanna raise the roof<br>
Until my shit is going down<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
(With you)<br>
How I used to hoop off in them tournaments<br>
(With you)<br>
And how I used to club hop on weekends<br>
(With you)<br>
Your family called the morning of the tragic end<br>
Damn, my condolensces<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 2]</i><br>
<br>
Voices in my head be telling me to come to church<br>
Saying the Lord is the only way for you to stop the hurt<br>
Dreaming of windows black tinted like a hearse<br>
When waking up to life sometimes seems worst<br>
And all I ever wanted is to be a better man<br>
And I try to keep it real with my homies land<br>
For me to save the world I don't understand<br>
How did I become the leader of a billion fans?<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
(With you)<br>
How I used to street perform on Friday<br>
(With you)<br>
And how I used to go to church on Easter Sunday<br>
(With you)<br>
Instead of you all throwing them stones at me<br>
Somebody pray for me<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 2 till end]</i>
Yo', what up, my n****<br>
You know I was in the hood<br>
I just thought I'd stop by<br>
Holler at you for a minute<br>
Pour out a little liquor or some'in'<br>
<br>
N****, we done been through a lot of s*** together<br>
From runnin' these streets to bein' down for whatever<br>
And now that you're gone I got a whole lot of s*** to<br>
tell you<br>
Things I should've said way back when we was younger<br>
<br>
Remember when we used to roll hand in hand<br>
And now I'm trippin' on how I really miss you, man<br>
And remember when you and me would say<br>
We'd get up out this hood and everything would be okay<br>
<br>
It's all good now (My n****)<br>
We out the hood now (Mmm)<br>
We had the same ideas, but not the same careers<br>
We shared the same old laugh, and now the same tears<br>
<br>
You were my homie, my sconey, my Roni<br>
My n**** and never placed no b**** before me<br>
Man, I sear to God I love for that s***<br>
Why'd you have to get hit<br>
Where was I, what time was it<br>
<br>
You were supposed to get older with me<br>
On stage, hands on shoulders with me<br>
Coppin' them Range Rovers with me<br>
Sittin' on thangs and smokin' trees<br>
<br>
And if it wasn't for the will that God had made<br>
I'd turn back the hands of time and take your place<br>
Sittin' here sippin' on this Hennessy<br>
Just thinkin' about how much you meant to me (My n***)<br>
<br>
Even when you're gone you will always be my n****<br>
When you went home I'm still missin' you, my n****<br>
I'm feelin' like the timing was wrong, my n****<br>
I know you're smilin' down sayin' carry on, my n****<br>
<br>
Some times my nights can get long, my n****<br>
Some times I feel God did me wrong, my n****<br>
So I had to write a song, my n****<br>
Just to let you know that you're still my n****<br>
<br>
I wish, I wish, I wish (Oh, I)<br>
I wish, I wish, I wish<br>
<br>
Little son is lookin' at me like, "Where is my daddy?"<br>
And your 13-year old daughter is mad ¡Rcause she<br>
understands<br>
Promised your mama I'd take care of the family<br>
But she's so hurt, she turns away my helpin' hands<br>
<br>
Damn, I wish your a** was here, my n****<br>
To grow that gray beard and smoke that cigar, my n****<br>
And we would talk about you gettin' up out this game<br>
And you would tell me how it keeps callin' your name<br>
<br>
(We used to ride-ride-ride)<br>
Never afraid to (Die-die-die)<br>
But some times we (Cry-cry-cry)<br>
Askin' the Lord (Why-why-why)<br>
They're tearin' down these projects<br>
<br>
We were homies for like 20 thug years<br>
Sat in church and cried the same thug tears<br>
You remember when Vibe World Premier<br>
How we used to share the same old gear<br>
<br>
And remember when you and me would say<br>
We'd get up out this hood and everything would be okay<br>
<br>
(It's all good now) My n****<br>
We out the hood now<br>
It's so easy for folks to say, "Rob, just live on"<br>
When I'm dyin' every second that you're gone<br>
Nevertheless I try my best to be strong<br>
Hopin' you said your prayers before you went on home<br>
<br>
When we stood on these blocks and just shot the breeze<br>
We'd slapbox dead in the middle of streets<br>
And if a fight broke out, you would take up for me<br>
You're all I have left of these ghetto memories<br>
<br>
I wish, I wish, I wish (Oh, I)<br>
I wish, I wish, I wish<br>
<br>
Uh, uh, yo' dog, I can't explain how I miss you<br>
We stayed together, coppin' cane, poppin' pistols<br>
I miss you most<br>
Puttin' the doo rag over your bean head<br>
Even out the hood on the scene you brag (Whoa)<br>
Comin' up off the fiends for bags<br>
Runnin' up out the cleaners, drag<br>
You was the closest n**** I had<br>
Look how we stayed aces<br>
Hustled, made big faces<br>
I wish we could trade places<br>
F*** givin' you ice, I'd rather give you life<br>
And the things that I had, I'd give you twice (Oh,yeah)<br>
<br>
So what the deal, my n****, I know you holdin' it down<br>
If you could see me you would say I'm talkin' soft<br>
right now<br>
But it's hard for me to see when I'mma see you again<br>
And I know it's f***ed up, I gotta talk through this<br>
pen<br>
But you'd died for the love of the dough<br>
The love of the block, 16 you was runnin' the spot<br>
Boy, your mama used to hate how we stood on the curb<br>
Hangin' with wild thug n****s, smokin' the herb (Mmm,<br>
hmm, hmm)<br>
I'm gonna keep pourin' this liquor and that's my word<br>
This here is for n****s that be flippin' them birds<br>
(Oh)<br>
Word up!<br>
<br>
Even though you know you will always be my n****<br>
(Whoa...whoa...oh...oh..)<br>
Even though you're gone you will also be my n****<br>
I'm feelin' like the time when I'm high, my n**** <br>
<br>
I'm feelin' like time<br>
I'm strung out, sayin', "Radio, please don't take the<br>
n**** out this song<br>
Let it play on, go on, on<br>
So I had to write this song, my n****<br>
Just to let you know that you're still my n****

It was you who helped me face it<br>
And now it's safe to say<br>
That you really care for me<br>
<br>
Just like the wings <br>
You took me, flew me away, yeah<br>
And now my ground is underneath my feet<br>
This man had nowhere to go<br>
Then you gave me direction<br>
And now the rest of my days<br>
I can't help but give you the praise<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
You saw my needs, forgave my faults<br>
You cleansed my heart, you changed my thoughts<br>
You brought the sun into my life<br>
When my world had seemed dark, yes you did<br>
And you're the only one <br>
Who was there when I needed a friend<br>
You're the only one who can place joy<br>
When there's pain in my heart<br>
<br>

Yo, for those who live the way that I live<br>

Fake Gazelles to black Pradas<br>
Selling nicks to trey bags, to making hits like Kidada Jones' father<br>
OG's would send me to the store with a dollar<br>
Hit me with some wise advice for me to follow<br>
Ain't nothing free in the world in life <br>

And some cost more than other's<br>
When you poor, it's like life ain't even worth living<br>
But when you rich, it's every fat ass worth hittin'<br>
With no chips, your drawers just stay on your hips<br>
I play with the six cuz money make the whole world spin<br>
But without the Franklin faces, you see who's your real friends<br>
It's V-12's, honeys on the cell, bobbin' out the JBL<br>
It's Nas and R. Kell<br>

Suddenly, I feel the need - to pull you close to me<br>
But I don't know, if it's what you want, baby<br>
Girl show me some kind of sign<br>
that tells me that you're, miiiine, all mine, baby<br>
It's gettin awfully warm, off in this room<br>
I'm gettin head up off yo' sweet perfume<br>
and I'm ready, to explore, every part of you<br>
Girl I'll take my clothes off first, then now you<br>
Ooooooooooo-oo-ooo-oo-ooo-oo-ooo-oo-ooo baby<br>
Baby.. tonight we'll be, naked<br>
Oooooooh, oooooooh, oooooooh, ooooooooh<br>
I'll take a stroll through your garden of love<br>
and show you so so much<br>
Just take my hand, and believe, in our fu-ture<br>
Gettin you open like matchin doors<br>
Sheets and covers on, the floor<br>
And if the bell should ring, we won't answer<br>
Girl I'll take my clothes off first, and now you<br>
Wanna tell, what I want from you<br>
<br>
Baby tonight I wanna see you naked<br>
So dim the lights<br>
Baby tonight I wanna see you naked<br>
I wanna see you tonight<br>
Baby tonight I wanna see you naked<br>
Oh babe, oh babe, yo' body's the reason for sight<br>
Baby tonight I wanna see you naked<br>
Ohhh-ohhh, naked
Can't you see we were meant to be, oh baby<br>
Down for each other for eternity, oh baby, baby<br>
Let me know if you're out of my life<br>
(Don't hang on) Don't hang on to my heart and say bye-bye<br>
I used to be the one that you could call on<br>
Now you like to play around - hit me up on what went wrong<br>

I'm not gonna hold on to your love baby<br>
If chances are that I'm gonna fall off <i>[2x's]</i><br>

You know just what to do to make my love come down<br>
I know just what you need, but you don't come around<br>
Let me know if you're out of my life<br>
Don't hang on to my heart, say bye-bye, oh baby<br>

Sorry for the things that happened to you, babe<br>
For what he did<br>
I'll show you that I'm not gonna do those things that he did to you<br>
I'm gonna love you I'm gonna hold you<br>
I'm gonna give you everythign that your heart desires<br>
You don't have to question love<br>
Cuz when I get home I'll show you love<br>

I know you're hurting baby<br>
Because of what he did<br>
But here I am to rescue you <br>
From that man of sin<br>
He took your life from you<br>
And noted you for him<br>
Promised you brighter days<br>
But now your light is dim<br>
He had no right to do<br>
The things he did to you<br>
If I had half a chance<br>
Girl, I'd be good to you<br>
Don't let don't let don't let don't let<br>

Now I was in a real bad abusive relationship<br>
Knowing that, that was no way for me to live<br>
A young girl like me, raised up in a good family<br>
Way too young to endure such misery<br>
And every night I cry myself to sleep from all the pain<br>
And the more I prayed for sunny days it seemed to rain<br>
(He hit me) at any given time<br>
(He hit me) no reason at all<br>
(He hit me) so so hard<br>
(He hit me) my God, sometimes I'd fall<br>
Mama asked what happened to me<br>
And I'd take up for him<br>
She said that devil's a liar<br>
And pray get rid of him<br>
And now I'm going to school<br>
Hitting those books<br>
I'm doing fine<br>
He's out my life<br>
I'm not confused<br>
Got peace of mind<br>
Man I tell you<br>
<br>
Prayer changes (it changes)<br>
Prayer changes (oh it changes)<br>
Prayer changes (I'm a witness that)<br>
Prayer changes things (said I know)<br>
Prayer changes (it changes)<br>
Prayer changes (it changes)<br>
Prayer changes (I'm a living witness that)<br>
Prayer changes things<br>
<br>
I was a freshman in college and uh<br>
I had just made it on the basketball team<br>
I had all the skills it took to make it<br>
But on my grades I would get nothing but all D's<br>
And the coach came to me <br>
And had a talk with me about my career<br>
Said if you don't get your grades up<br>
I'm gonna have to sit you down this year<br>
Man as tough as I was I broke down and cried<br>
'Cause everybody knows me<br>
Knows that basketball is my life<br>
(Algebra) I studied hard<br>
(Chemistry) I gave my all<br>
(Calculus) oh my God<br>
(English) so many flaws<br>
Playing ball didn't look to good for me<br>
My future, could not see<br>
I had lost all my beliefs<br>
And gave up on all my dreams<br>
Then I went to church on Sunday<br>
And the pastor began to preach<br>
It was like he was talking to me<br>
When he said I can do all things<br>
In Christ that strengthens me<br>
And for me that was enough<br>
Now that I went from a D<br>
All the way to an A plus<br>
I tell you prayer changes things<br>
<br>
Prayer changes <br>
Prayer changes (prayer)<br>
Prayer changes (it changes things)<br>
Prayer changes things (oh)<br>
Prayer changes (said it changes)<br>
Prayer changes (things)<br>
Prayer changes (I'm a living witness that)<br>
Prayer changes things<br>
<br>
Me and my wife had a few problems<br>
We thought that nothing could solve them<br>
Listening to family members and so called friends<br>
Man I tell you that's just how the devil creeps in<br>
We were separated at least for a month or two<br>
She was wilding in the clubs<br>
And I was out there doing wrong too<br>
And we would walk around the house<br>
Putting each other down<br>
I mean right in front of the kids<br>
We would curse each other out<br>
Then I was in a bad accident<br>
And almost lost my life<br>
And guess who was there for me<br>
My wife<br>
Now ain't it funny how He makes a way<br>
When we said there was no way<br>
I'm out the hospital and back at home<br>
Planning another wedding day, I tell you<br>
<br>
Prayer changes (it changes)<br>
Prayer changes (prayer changes)<br>
Prayer changes (prayer changes)<br>
Prayer changes things (things, I'm a witness that)<br>
Prayer changes (change)<br>
Prayer changes (prayer changes)<br>
Prayer changes (prayer changes)<br>
Prayer changes things<br>
<br>
Now all of these things were happening in one family<br>
But that's okay, cause there's nothing God can't achieve<br>
I don't care what the problem in your life may be<br>
Cause who the Son sets free, is free indeed<br>
And if you didn't know, now you should know<br>
All you have to do is take this family life for example<br>
Now Mom and Dad are married again<br>
Four kids now, cause they just had twins<br>
Little sister all grown up now<br>
She's a lawyer, married with one child now<br>
Two years, big brother's out of college<br>
And man he's got his hands full<br>
Blessed with skills, blessed with knowledge<br>
Now he's playing for the Chicago Bulls<br>
<br>
Prayer changes (I'm a witness yeah)<br>
Prayer changes (prayer changes)<br>
Prayer changes (prayer changes)<br>
Prayer changes things (woah when it looks like)<br>
Prayer changes (you can't go on)<br>
Prayer changes (I know that prayer)<br>

Prayer changes (cause it changes things)<br>
Prayer changes things (yeah)<br>

Prayer changes (Heaven's got a hold on you)<br>
Prayer changes things (yeah)<br>
Prayer changes (when it seems you can't go on)<br>
Prayer changes (and all your strength is gone)<br>
Prayer changes (hold on it won't be long)<br>
Prayer changes things (I know prayer is gonna change)<br>
Prayer changes (drinking or doing drugs)<br>
Prayer changes (even if you're running the streets)<br>
Prayer changes (even in the music field)<br>
Prayer changes things (rock, pop or R&B)<br>
Prayer changes (prayer will change)<br>
Prayer changes (prayer will change)<br>
Prayer changes (prayer will change)<br>
Prayer changes things....
<i>[Chorus (Jay-Z)]</i><br>
The power of the P-U-S-S-Y,<br>
Thatz why every mutherfucka in the world dress fly.<br>
Every baller<br>

(Let's have some fun)<br>
The power of the P-U-S-S-Y, thatz why niggaz get they hair cut, try to dress fly.<br>
Every baller that can afford it he cop the best ride.<br>
For the Power of the P-U-S-S-Y.<br>

<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br>
I-I know this girl we call her Sweet Cooch Brown.<br>
Hands down mami had the bombest pussy in town.<br>
One dip in the girl pool, thatz all it took.<br>
One sample of the snappa and ya ass was whooped.<br>
Have you buyin Gucci sandals matchin pocketbooks.<br>
Blowin up her beeper, ringin her phone off the hook.<br>
Ball playaz they spent money, rappers they spent time.<br>
All the while both claimin that they never spent a dime.<br>
Buisness guys you were victimised.<br>
Have 'em payin rent on condos in a Miami High Rise.<br>
They ask her, "Who pussy's this?"<br>
Look her right in her eyes. <br>
She say, "This pussy's yours, Daddy"<br>
Tell 'em nothin but lies.<br>
Ha! They didn't believe it, but they wanted to.<br>
Needed to. She had the type of body that you didn't want leavin you.<br>
So they ignored all her flirtin ways and put a ring on her finger.<br>
I'm like, "Earth to Dave!" <br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br>
Naw..I ain't no rapper but I'mma sing my shit<br>

And thatz why I be givin mami much dick dick dick.<br>
While yall chumps be copin diamonds and fur and all that,<br>
Fiendin for this pussy as if yall was on crack.<br>
When it comes to the truth, I can't hold back.<br>
Ya'll cats that be babysittin  these broads need to be smacked.<br>
It's this nigga named Monroe that I know from way back.<br>
He hit the lotto, bought this girl a Cadillac.<br>
Now this bitch be creepin behind this niggaz back.<br>
Me bust his nut guess what he still took the bitch back.<br>
Three things niggaz love...money, pussy, and drugs.<br>
Can't get one without the other unless you soft and in love. <br>
Yall take it from a playa who's done all the above.<br>
Niggaz it the lesbian R&B thug.<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
<br>
<i>[Devin the Dude]</i><br>
The P is for the pearl tongue that I like to tickle.<br>
The U is for uterus, down deep in the middle.<br>
SS is so slippery when I go up inside.<br>
Pussy's good and if you gettin some I know you know Y.<br>
See I got my first shot when I was bout 7.<br>
Her father called my house he said,<br>
"I need to talk to yo son Devin.<br>
My daughter she's 11 and she goes to the same school that yo son goes to.<br>
And she said today she got screwed."<br>
But my daddy answer the phone so no drama, and all he said was,<br>
"No shit! Let me talk to that girl mama!"<br>
Then i was suspended 3 day, tooken from school.<br>
It was like a vacation.<br>
Niggaz lookin at pussy at the pool in our apartments.<br>
I started hittin hard when I was small.<br>
Let me recite a story lesson for all of yall.<br>
See pussy's like a wound it would never heal,<br>
the more ointment you put on then the better it feels.<br>
Cuz it's...<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br>

She didn't have a house, a house up in the hills<br>
I never heard her ask for some car with the chromed out wheels<br>
But all she wanted was some love and affection<br>
But all I did all the time was neglect<br>
The fact that she was lonely, I used to be her homey<br>
I used to talk about how I was gonna get us out of the hood<br>
But as long as we're together as a family, then it's all good<br>
<br>
<i>[1]</i> - Because any man can make a baby<br>
But it takes a real man to be a father<br>
Talking about a family, the kid, you and me<br>
It's not a fantasy, but it's reality<br>
You see love is wrong and love is right<br>
But if love is strong then love is tight<br>
Talking about a chemistry like a bride-to-be<br>
It's not a fantasy, but it's reality<br>
<br>
Be careful were the words the last time we had our talk<br>
And your truth sound absurd so my pride just let you walk<br>
When all the time knowing that I didn't mean<br>
To hollar out and call you bitch and tell you leave<br>
I admit it, I was wrong but now it's over come on home<br>
I can't take it here is where you belong<br>
Even out the window looking for the mailman<br>
I hope he's got a letter says, I'm missing you, in the mail<br>
And then I saw you with another, made it hard for me to breathe<br>
But when I played the game for gives<br>
I should've played the game for keeps<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
Now I wore the shoes that you talked about in your song<br>
But it's been a change I've got a new pair on, yes<br>
Now every night and day I still await<br>
At the lonely spot in the hills<br>
And think about how you set the record straight<br>
Any man can<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1 until fade]</i>
Dearly beloved, why did you go<br>
When being with you forever is all I hope<br>
Slowly the rain is falling in our home<br>
Come back and start right from going wrong<br>
I'll be still until I hear from you<br>
And I'll be waiting until you return this message<br>
<br>
A religious love for you baby<br>
Every night I pray <br>
That heaven will send you back to me<br>
Baby you're all I ever needed <br>
Religious love for ya baby<br>
Every night I pray <br>
That someday I'll have you for my wife<br>
Baby you are my life, please believe me<br>
<br>
For only God knows how much I miss you<br>
And for us to be one it takes two<br>
So don't you go dying on me not right now<br>
Please change the impossible to somehow<br>
I'll be still there until I hear from you<br>
And I'll be praying until you return this message<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
In the middle of the night, I'll be callin' you<br>
Every single breath I take I hope to see you there<br>
If you should ever need, if ever you need a friend<br>
Baby I am here and don't forget to remember me<br>
<br>
Oh baby, come to me - don't leave me lonely<br>
I need you here with me so return this message<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
Early one Sunday morning<br>
Breakfast was on the table<br>
There was no time to <br>
Eat<br>
She said to me boy hurry to Sunday school<br>
Filled with the long of glory <br>
We learned the holy story<br>
She'll always have her dreams<br>
Despite the things <br>
<br>
This troubled world can bring.<br>
<br>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br>
<br>
Oh Sadie don't you know we love you sweet Sadie<br>
<br>
Place No one above you sweet Sadie<br>
<br>
Well Well Well<br>
<br>
Living in the past<br>
<br>
Sometimes it seems so funny, no money can turn your life around<br>
<br>
Sweeter than cotton candy<br>
Stronger than papas' old Brandy<br>
Always that needed <br>
Smile<br>
Once in awhile she would break down and cry<br>
Sometimes she'd be so <br>
Happy<br>
Being with us and daddy<br>
Standing the worst of times<br>
Breaking the <br>
Binds with just a simple song<br>
<br>
<i>[CHORUS]</i><br>
<br>
Oh Sadie<br>

Gotta come hard cause these are the last days<br>
When I, do it I do's it, ain't no more to it (word)<br>
Ask Ice Cube, I puts my back into it<br>
From car dealers to Macy's, to cashiers that brace me<br>
We train like the Navy for whatever the case may be<br>
I pass on the 6, they don't impress me much<br>
I want the bulletproof 7 cause the doors lift up<br>
They pick the best of all girls, so how y'all sound?<br>
I got the best of both worlds, holdin me down<br>

Panties and bras all the way from the bed to the sofa<br>
For all you R&B so called playas, I'm bout to coach ya<br>
Sit right there, and watch me freak yo girl chocha<br>
Tounge all down her throat as if a nigga was trying to choke her<br>

Put ya hands up like it's money in the air<br>
We bout to rip these charts like Zorro Blade<br>

Out of all the girls I've loved before<br>
Got plenty of honeys--<br>
Puff puff give now let me hit it once more<br>
Fake ass niggas get out and close my door<br>
Its my house for me to live not yours<br>
If I wanted to I could- on the floors<br>
Through the doors like a western flick the club is crunk<br>
Penny and Chris you know that boys tow up<br>
About 8 or 9 black stallion riding up<br>
Its Mr. Big screaming showdown I'm like what...<br>
<br>
<i>[Mr. Big]</i><br>
Now Kelly-<br>
Its not enough room in this town<br>
For you and me so lets get down<br>
I'm sick and tired of you and this down low fight<br>
From contagious all the way to Mrs. Price<br>
You done it now with Ms. Black Asia<br>
I knew something was funny when she stopped paging<br>
House, cars, shopping mall<br>
Man I tell you its a battle call<br>
Like a raging bull<br>
I'm about to charge<br>
Kelly, you won't see tomorrow<br>
Its time to put a end to your late night creeps<br>
Now any last words before my pistol speaks...<br>
<br>
<i>[(R. Kelly) -spits-]</i><br>
Mr. Biggs-<br>
Now no disrespect but man I'm tired<br>
Cause all these years its my back you've been riding<br>
We've been in and out of fights on these videos<br>
Now its about time you felt the real rodeo<br>
See I dated lila '98 of September<br>
You took her from me yea right you don't remember<br>
I remember so clearly we were coming from an opera<br>
How clever you were when you slipped her your number<br>
(ooh) I know that makes ya'll wanna know<br>
(ooh) Who's really on the down low<br>
You wonder why we're always at it there it is<br>
Sleeves up Mr. Biggs<br>
Cause I'm about to get- wild, wild, west<br>
Sick and tired of your mess<br>
You put me to the test <br>
And now I'm sticking out my chest<br>
So any last words before I draw these cannons<br>
Cause when the smoke clears I'll be the last man standing<br>
<br>

Somebody's girl is at this party (woo!)<br>
Drink that glass of Cris' (that's right)<br>
Somebody's girl is at this party (uh)<br>
Sittin in V.I.P.<br>
Somebody's girl (yeah) is at this party (that's right)<br>
And she's comin home with me<br>
<br>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br>
Ummmmmm.. I don't mean no harm<br>
But your boy young Hov' got a mean ol' arm<br>
Got all the young ladies wanna lean on him<br>
And I don't turn them away, I'm like - bring them on<br>
Now - where's her man is not my concern<br>
It's not what I'm worried about, I'm just tryin to hurry her out<br>
Clear her whole area out<br>
And bring this whole party little nearer to my house<br>
Now - where's her spouse?  I don't know<br>
So, I don't ask, I don't probe<br>
I just - get in 6, get out on Rov'<br>
Let her, sip on Cris', go out on tours<br>
Now - back at the lab, I'm actin bad<br>
Cause the, pool is warm, a booze is on<br>
Just a - select few, the fools are gone<br>
It's slow jams and the grooves is on, groove on<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus: R. Kelly]</i><br>
Somebody's girl is at this party<br>
Shakin that ass to this<br>
Somebody's girl is at this party<br>
Drink that glass of Cris'<br>
Somebody's girl is at this party<br>
Sittin in V.I.P.<br>
Somebody's girl is at this party<br>
And she's comin home with me<br>
<br>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br>
Uhh, is it my fault they call me young heat rock<br>
Hardhead, go through walls like sheet rock<br>
And she's comin with me, when the beat stop<br>
When the party is done, I party with hon<br>
Now - is it my fault you neglect your broad<br>
and she wanna party with me, no ex at all?<br>
No ex-boyfriend, no ex involved<br>
Just the highway exit that we exit off<br>
And I - fall back, I let her talk<br>
I inquire sometime, I admire her mind<br>
I - like her wit, I'm lovin her shoes<br>
I'm a alternative rap, I'm playin the blues<br>
I'm a thorough street nigga never breakin the rules<br>
And her man's shortcomin is turnin me into somethin<br>
that of which she has never seen<br>
So she wanna crossover where the grass is green, knahmean?<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
<br>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br>
The moral of the story if you love your bitch<br>
you better - hold your hoe, hug your bitch<br>
You better - slow your roll, trick some bread<br>
When she wanna go out, you like Craig and 'em said<br>
"See ya when I see ya," now she's callin me up<br>
And I'm like, "Geah, of course I wanna chill"<br>
Now she with the real, and you all fed<br>
Like, "I'ma crack her motherfuckin fo'head!"<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
<i>[1]</i> - All that money I spend<br>
All those places I been<br>
I can't forget you babe<br>
Here's life without you<br>
Working hard for this loot<br>
Girl I wanna spend it with you <br>
I want you with me babe<br>
Here's life without you<br>
<br>
Baby, through all the ups and down<br>
You were a lady<br>
I wanna show you how I love you<br>
Baby, deserve the very best<br>
And I, I'll give it to you, only you<br>
How can I show you that <br>
Only you satisfy everything that you do<br>
Baby girl, anything that you want<br>
I'll give to you <br>
Just promise me forever, boo<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
Baby I can't imagine life without you<br>
With me, I never want to be without you<br>
Baby, I want you to believe it's true <br>
All that I do, I do for you<br>
How can I show you that<br>
Only you could satisfy, everything that you do<br>
Anything that you want I'll give to you <br>
Just promise me forever, boo<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
Don't know why you stayed by my side for so long<br>
So I dedicate baby, in every way <br>
All my heart and soul<br>
It all belongs to you<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1 until fade]</i>
I can see my destination , I can hear my call<br>
No more hesitation this time I'm going for all<br>
Cause I know where this road leads to and therefore I will rise,<br>

Spirit spirit would you guide me<br>

<i>[1]</i> - I say the easiest thing in the world<br>
Is to love you<br>
And the hardest thing in the world<br>
Is to lose you<br>
<br>
Said I tried and tried again to keep you <br>
But it just ain't no use<br>
I'm baffled cuz of what went down<br>
See I got your letter so you're leaving town<br>
Just take one minute to think about<br>
Baby, lets back track on what happened in this house<br>
Now I remember clearly it was a Saturday<br>
I came walkin' in four o'clock in the morning<br>
And I thought you were sleepin' one eye opened<br>
You turned and said to me where the hell you been<br>
Then I turned it around and hollared with some friends drinking<br>
And now I'm sitting here all alone<br>
Wishing you were here to house this home, oh<br>
<br>
Say the easiest thing in the world is to love you <br>
I love you baby<br>
And the hardest thing in the world (So hard) <br>
Is to lose you (Is to lose you baby)<br>
<br>
<i>[2]</i> - Now I'm sitting here sippin' on things <br>
I'm not suppose to (Sittin right here)<br>
And that ain't cool (You know that ain't cool)<br>
I've got to get over losing you<br>
<br>
Shattered I can't believe you're gone<br>
I'm left in the middle of these four walls<br>
Lying helpless 'bout to lose my mind baby<br>
I can't fathom life without you by my side<br>
Now every night before I go to sleep<br>
I pray to heaven for a better me<br>
Nights I'm up thinkin' and days I'm up dreamin' <br>
You were at work I was at play<br>
A nigga wanted you and plus his cake<br>
I know I ain't got no right to say<br>
But I need you to head on back this way<br>
Because I'm sitting here all alone<br>
Wishing you were here to house this home<br>
<br>

See, sometimes we men, we can dish it out<br>
But sometimes we men, we can't take it, hey<br>
So I'm gonna get up out this chair<br>
And catch me a train, and get where you are, hey<br>
Because I love you babe<br>
And i need you <br>
Right here by my side<br>
Ghetto woman come on home to me<br>
I'm dying sorry and I can't seem to break free
Girl, you know you knock me out<br>
You're a real girl with your looks now baby<br>
Girl you know you knock me out<br>

*Summer bunnies drive me crazy<br>
<i>[repeat 4 times with ad libs]</i><br>
<br>
1,2,3,4 it's time for me to jet<br>
Where ya goin' off to?<br>
The beach, that's a bet<br>
It's summertime so it's time to get a summer bunny<br>
<br>
Some of those and I won't call 'em whores<br>
'Cause in the 90s you gotta respect the ladies<br>
So step up to 'em and say, we love you sweet Sadie<br>
That's how you get your true mock on but<br>
Brothers be steppin' up poppin' that sad song<br>
<br>
Hey don't I know you from somewhere?<br>
Can we go somewhere to be alone?<br>
I pull up in the lot, pop the trunks<br>
Make their heads bob<br>
And it's sunny so it's time to get a summer bunny<br>
<br>
<i>[*Repeat]</i><br>
<br>
It's five o'clock and my voice code is 22<br>
So beep, beep, beep, it's time for me to make a move<br>
I'm on my way to a picnic, we got time<br>
But I wanna be early, fool<br>
So I can catch the new bunnies comin' in<br>
Like the old school<br>
<br>
Strollin' the block so I can check the scenery<br>
The sun plays, the day is feelin' good to me<br>
I can just semll the funky beats<br>
You know the flavor in between the sheets<br>
<br>
I told my boy Big Al, said just keep it straight<br>
Said, I know I got a novelty to validate<br>
So who's the bunny lookin' sweet like a honeycomb?<br>
He said, "No my brother, you got to get your own"<br>
<br>
<i>[*Repeat]</i><br>
<br>
This party is packed, word to the mother<br>
I love it when there's three bunnies to one brother<br>
And wine coolers is what I'm packin'<br>
And when I get my buzz on is when I start bunny-jackin'<br>
<br>
Jackin' fools for their bunnies<br>
'Cause I'm the K, the E, the double L, the Y<br>
They wanna get with me<br>
And the PAs in the house<br>
So check, check, check it out<br>
<br>
My stomach is growlin' so it's time to get mine on<br>
Some soul food, Kool Aid and you know it's on<br>
I hate to eat and run but I'm out my homie<br>
Been invited to a block party<br>
<br>
So we roll up in all our style<br>
With the brothers yellin', summer bunnies<br>

<i>[Chorus 2X: R. Kelly + (Girl)]</i><br>
Girl you know you got a body-adi-adi (do you like it?)<br>
Where you get your little body-adi-adi (do you want it?)<br>
Girl I wanna freak your body-adi-adi (what you want it?)<br>
I just wanna take you home with me<br>
<br>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br>
She get it from her momma..<br>
You can't tie a sweater over that ass, it hotter than pajamas<br>
We lay back, blowin ganja<br>
DVD, she make it hard to watch a flat TV - WHOA<br>
I crept up behind her<br>
Mami threw it like a quarterback, I caught that like Rice<br>
I call mami Montana, bandana<br>
Tied her hands up - this is gangsta love<br>
Threw on a rap CD, we gangsta fucked<br>
This ain't R&B smooth, I ain't a R&B dude<br>
Poured a glass of Army, got mami in the mood<br>
Then she stripped for me like the "Moulin Rouge"<br>
I think I might wife her<br>
Y'know, powder blue Roc-a-Wear suit, white Nike her<br>
Add mami to the cypher<br>
R.O.C. for life cuz, the gang motherfucker<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br>
I make ya hotter than the next bitch - no need<br>
for you to ever sweat the next bitch - with speed<br>
I make the next bitch see the exit - indeed<br>
Gotta know you're ver-ily respected - by me<br>
You get the keys to the Lexus - but no drive<br>
You get your own 2002, she through ridin<br>
Keep yo' ass tighter than Versace<br>
That's why you gotta watch yo' friends<br>
You gotta watch me, they connivin shit<br>
See I just wanna freak your body-adi-adi<br>
I know you don't do this for everybody-adi<br>
But everybody ain't as horny as me<br>
And your body's - callin, me...<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
<br>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br>
Uhh, yeah<br>
Mami shot through the pad with the Mark Jacobs bag<br>
The thick stitched seam and her favorite ass jeans<br>
Y'all know the first date wearers<br>
to make objects bigger than they appear like a rearview mirror<br>
Oh her shoe game is real<br>
She gave 'em the Christian Libountins(?) with the four inch heels<br>
But honestly my favorite type of gear<br>
is a scrungy for her hair and LaPearla underwear, clear?<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br>
Girl I hear you callin, let's stop stallin<br>
Do what we came to do<br>
Girl I hear you callin, let's stop stallin<br>
Baby I want you, yeah<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
What's up baby<br>
I know what you're thinking<br>
What did I call you over here for <br>
I wanna take you somewhere<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
Tempo slow, lights down low<br>
Let me take you to a place<br>
Where only love grooves go<br>
<br>
Step into my territory <br>
And let the vibes begin<br>
Don't be afraid<br>
Just let this love groove in<br>
Let the passion lead you to a place beyond<br>
Exploring my bedroom, having freaky fun<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
<br>
All the players go<br>
All the gangstas go<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
<br>
Rules they are so simple, so very simple<br>
As our bodies connect <br>
And those juices start to flow<br>
Makin' sweet love 'til the morning light<br>
And satisfying love's appetite<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus (2x's)]</i><br>
<br>
Baby tell Daddy what it is you want<br>
Come on and unravel those little secrets unknown<br>
Time to taste what love has in store for me<br>
So let's take a sip of this love groove chemistry<br>
<br>

Finally the weekend's come <br>

He's right captain, this is big<br>
Only if we allow him to reach his destination.<br>
We're waiting on an order, sir. Sir?<br>
Hater One, this is your captain<br>
I order you to take the talent out.<br>
Do not, I repeat, do not under any circumstances <br>
Let this disc be heard. Over<br>
Roger that sir, all systems go. <br>
Minus 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0
Umm pum-pum-pum<br>
Pum-pum, pum-pum, pum-pum<br>
<br>
Look behind myself<br>
As I reflect on all the memories<br>
The times they come and go<br>
Lost everything from friends to Family<br>
If I could turn back the hands<br>
There would be some things I'd change about me<br>
I know that my past is not what my future holds<br>
<br>
Where I come from<br>
Who could believe<br>
All the pain and misery<br>
Look in my eyes and you'll see<br>
The diary of me<br>
<br>
Rewind my life<br>
Just go back and correct all the wrong<br>
And ask God to direct my path<br>
So that I can make it home<br>
And if I could turn back the hands of time<br>
There would be some things I would change about me<br>
But I know that my past is not what my future holds<br>
'Cause<br>
<br>
Where I'm from<br>
Who could believe<br>
All the pain, misery<br>
Look in my eyes and you will see<br>
The diary of me<br>
<br>
Years ago a child was born (a child was born) (ooh)<br>
And raised without a man (without my... father, and wonder why he's in these streets) (ooh)<br>
<br>
My mother's gone (mothers gone, yet still... found the strength to pray for me) (ooh)<br>
But still reached out her hand<br>
Just open the book (na-na-na-na-na-na)<br>
Turn the pages of my life (na-na-na)<br>
And you will read<br>
A true story about one man's journey<br>
<br>
Where I'm from (ahh...)<br>
Who would believe, yeah<br>
That all the hurt and pain and misery (ahh...)<br>
Look in my eyes (ahh...)<br>
You'll see the diary of me (pum-pum-pum-pum-pum)<br>
Where I'm from (where I'm from, who could believe) (ahh...)<br>
Who could believe (the hurt and pain and misery)<br>
(Look in my eyes) in my eyes (and you will see) (ahh...)<br>
(The makings of) the makings of<br>
(My diary) my diary<br>
(Where I'm from) look in my eyes (ahh...)<br>
(Who could believe) you'll see<br>
(The hurt and pain and misery)<br>
(Look in my eyes) (ahh...)<br>
(And you will see) yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah<br>
(The makings of my diary)<br>
(Where I'm from...) (ahh...)
From beyond this bed of mine I see<br>
Ceiling fans with you on top of me<br>
And the window blinds are filled with rays of sun<br>
And all you secret fantasies thy will be done (done)<br>
And inside of your walls there will dwell a Capricorn <br>
(that will feast your body all night)<br>

All because<br>

I was in a tunnel<br>
And couldn't see the light<br>
And whenever I'd look up<br>
I couldn't see the sky<br>
Sometimes when I'm standin'<br>
It seems like I done walked for miles<br>
And my heart could be cryin'<br>
Dead in the middle of a smile<br>
<br>
But then I climbed the hills<br>
And saw the mountains<br>
I hollered help 'cause I was lost<br>
Then I felt the strong wind<br>
Heard a small voice sayin'<br>
<br>
The storm is over<br>
(The storm is over now)<br>
And I can see the sunshine<br>
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)<br>
I feel Heaven, yeah<br>
(Heaven is over me)<br>
Come on and set me free, whoa<br>
<br>
Now in the midst of my battle<br>
All hope was gone<br>
Downtown in a rushed crowd<br>
And felt all alone<br>
And every now and then<br>
I felt like I would lose my mind<br>
I've been racin' for years<br>
And still no finish line, oh<br>
<br>
But then I climbed the hills<br>
And saw the mountains (Mountains)<br>
I hollered help 'cause I was lost<br>
Then I felt the strong wind<br>
And then a small voice sayin'<br>
<br>
The storm is over<br>
(The storm is over now)<br>
And I can see the sunshine<br>
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)<br>
I can feel Heaven, yeah<br>
(Heaven is over me)<br>
<br>
Come on and set me free<br>
<br>
Somehow my beginning stepped right in (Right in)<br>
Then faith became my friend (My friend)<br>
And now I can depend<br>
On the voices of the wind<br>
When it's sayin' (Sayin')<br>
<br>
The storm is over<br>
(The storm is over now)<br>
And I can see the sunshine<br>
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)<br>
I can feel Heaven, yeah<br>
(Heaven is over me)<br>
<br>
Won't you come and set me free<br>
Won't you set me free<br>
<br>
The storm is over<br>
(The storm is over now)<br>
And I can see the sunshine<br>
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)<br>
I can feel Heaven, yeah<br>
(Heaven is over me)<br>
Won't you come and set me free<br>
<br>
<i>[Ad lib until fade]</i>
Dear God.. how can I explain myself?<br>
<i>[J]</i> Oh God bless me indeed<br>
When I'm so confused<br>
<i>[J]</i> Enlarge my territory<br>
<i>[J]</i> Place your love and protection over me at all times<br>
Help me!<br>
<i>[J]</i> Keep me away from evil<br>
Somebody answer me! <i>[echoes]</i><br>
<i>[J]</i> Allow me not to cause pain<br>
<br>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br>
Police in the background, screamin put the thing down<br>
That's how hard I was trying to put my thing down<br>
Si-rens ringin out, old ladies screamin out<br>
All this attention for me and I'm barely sixteen now<br>
.. it's feelin like a dream now<br>
Handcuffed, roughed up, I'm tossed in the bing now<br>
I'm lyin next to fiends now, that's the end of the story<br>
Let me bring y'all niggaz back to the very first scene now<br>
December 4th, a child is born<br>
Before I knew it, had my pops trousers on<br>
That's how we do it when the man of the house is gone<br>
You either, stand or fall, I chose to stand<br>
The hawk outside, so I blow my hand<br>
It's a cold cold world but I overstand<br>
Tryin to stay focused but I feel hopeless damn<br>
Can't cope with bein broke, I'm a man - c'mon<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus: R. Kelly]</i><br>
Son don't let these streets, get the best of you<br>
I will be right by your side, when you goin through<br>
Son just don't let it (just don't let it)<br>
Just don't let it (just don't let it)<br>
Just don't let it (just don't let it)<br>
.. get the best of you<br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br>
Late one night I was, rollin the streets<br>
Just, thinkin about what's goin on with me and<br>
trapped in this thug life, tryin to break free but<br>
this thug life just keeps callin me<br>
I'm livin life way too dangerously<br>
I'm drownin in my misery<br>
Looked in the mirror, there's my enemy<br>
Cause poppa never was a part of me<br>
Take one step at a time, mama said<br>
Sweet memories still remain in my head<br>
All of my life been lied to, misled<br>
Voices be like, "Don't you wish you was dead?"<br>
No ground to place my feet<br>
I feel the fire under me<br>
A way out is all I need<br>
Somebody, answer me!<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus + ad libs]</i><br>
<br>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br>
Now the only thing left is more spirit to roam free<br>
.. cause ain't no goin home for me<br>
It's a cold cold world but I blew my hand<br>
A true first cause I knew that man<br>
I knew what he would do if I didn't draw first<br>
And I couldn't stand the thought of my momma steppin foot inside a church<br>
All I try to do is try to get up out the dirt<br>
Guess he's tryin to do the same, told me get up out his turf<br>
I wanted to talk to him, but that shit'd never work<br>
We was cut from the same cloth and what was under his shirt was his<br>
momma's rent, his young brother's clothes<br>
My nephew's food, and with that I suppose<br>
.. and with that I froze<br>
Now my life is frozen in time behind these iron folds<br>
And this story is told, for young soldiers<br>
who never choose the life we chose<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus + (ad libs)]</i><br>
<br>
<i>[R. Kelly]</i><br>
Tears in my eyes as I look up, I'm tryin to<br>
hold back my pride but reality is screamin<br>
Gotta get a job cause mo-mma also screamin<br>
Streets are just like drugs, and it's like I'm out here fiendin<br>
Forget all the hits in the industry, cause<br>
ain't no exceptions in this game for me, look<br>
Neither God or my enemies, I<br>
choose God cause he understands, this<br>
young man with a thuggish heart<br>
Whole world in his hands but still torn apart<br>
Like I'm so close, but it's still so far<br>
Nightmares of me in a swervin car, ohhh<br>
No ground to place my feet (my feet)<br>
I feel the fire under me (heyyy)<br>
A way out is all I need (all I need)<br>
Somebody, answer me!<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus + ad libs]</i>
Hit it hard from the back<br>
Roll around on the front<br>
I know you've heard a lot of tracks<br>
But 12 Play is what you want<br>
Just let me call the studio<br>
Then we can go all night<br>
Girl I hope you can hang<br>
Cause I'm horny as hell tonight<br>
<br>
One<br>
Taking off your Secrets with my teeth<br>
Two <br>
Slightly rough to let you know it's about to get kinky<br>
Three<br>
Blind your eyes, then I walk you to my bedroom<br>
Four<br>
Now open your eyes <br>
Surprise you've entered twelve play two<br>
<br>
Stop<br>
We need to catch our breath<br>
We've been going for a while<br>
It's been about two hours<br>
And we're still going round for round<br>
The water's getting cold<br>
And the movie's going off<br>
This is how we do in TP-2<br>
<br>
Five <br>
I'm about to take you for a ride<br>
Now feel it come inside<br>
Six<br>
Baby it's as hard as a brick<br>
Tell me can you feel this sh, sh, sh<br>
Seven<br>
That's when to slow it down<br>
Cause I'm not ready to<br>
Eight<br>
We're almost at the peak<br>
Cause I'm feeling tingly<br>
<br>
Now flew your body like, what (what, what)<br>
It's like diamonds with the cut (cut, cut)<br>
The hottest out of your friends<br>
The way you take it from me<br>
Girl you put it on me like draws<br>
Moaning when you talk<br>
I'm about to tear your shit out<br>
New millennium style<br>
<br>
Nine<br>
Lookin' you in your eyes<br>
As I'm about to do that thing<br>
Ten<br>
Then on down to your thighs <br>
I'm gonna make you scream<br>
Eleven<br>
Now put your body on top of me<br>
I'm about to grab your waist<br>
Twelve <br>
Now quick before we get to thirteen<br>
Set it on my face
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
Trade in my life <br>
Oh for you, oh yes, oh yes<br>
Trade in my life for you<br>
<br>
Sittin' here wonderin' how did things go wrong<br>
Every night asking myself what happened to our happy home<br>
Will I ever see you again, I need to know my friend<br>
Now the past has gone away but tomorrow's on it's way<br>
Though the sun is going down, I need you around<br>
I'm willing to trade in my life<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
Now I'm sitting here <br>
Reminiscing on what we used to share<br>
And how we used to be such a happy pair, oh yeah<br>
I cannot believe we've thrown it all away<br>
Tell me will I see you again someday?<br>
<br>
Now the past is gone away <br>
But tomorrow's on it's way<br>
Though the sun is going down<br>
And I need you around - trade<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
<br>
We both know that we made a vow <br>
Said we'd always be together<br>
That our love would endure, yes<br>
But now you're gone and I'm all alone<br>
But I need you here and I'm willing to trade it<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
<br>
I mean it from the bottom of my heart<br>
Tell me are you with me, are you willing to trade it<br>
<br>
And I don't even have to think about it twice<br>
Hey, I'll trade it<br>
Somebody help me say I'll trade it<br>
Until you return to me<br>
I'm gonna stay on my hands and knees<br>
And when I see you I'm gonna stand up<br>
And reach my hands out to you, and trade it<br>
<br>
Said I love my music and I love my fans<br>
But I've got to step back<br>
Look at this thing like it sure enough is<br>
Tell me do you remember when we used to say<br>
Everything is in their love tell me<br>
<br>
What does it profit a man<br>
To gain the world and lose his soul?<br>
I'm gonna trade it to be with you

I was riding in my car one day<br>
In the express lane rollin on the freeway<br>
And suddenly the phone rings then I<br>
Reached down beside me then i look<br>
On the floor felt on the backseat<br>
See I was drinking while I was driving<br>
Never thinking bout what I was doing<br>
I turned around and before i knew it<br>
Here comes this truck now<br>
<br>
Doctor said don't think he gonna make it<br>
Family said make the funeral arrangements<br>
Unplug the machine he's gone now <br>
Then told my wife to be strong now<br>
Then a small voice said told me<br>
If you promise to stop drinking<br>
I surrendered on that day<br>
Now for ten years i've been straight<br>
<br>
You saved me <i>[4x]</i><br>
Gave me a second chance<br>
You saved me <i>[3x]</i><br>
You saved me<br>
<br>
Now i've been sitting in this chair<br>
Waiting on the phone to ring<br>
Praying up to God that someone will call<br>
Me with a job opening<br>
Cause it's been so hard for me<br>
Month to month struggling to eat<br>
But still there was no answer<br>
I stop believing in his word and<br>
Got so mad at him and<br>
When somebody said God's good<br>
I just laugh at 'em<br>
<br>
But in the nick of time his blessing<br>
Rain on me<br>
By his grace the phone ring<br>
A lady said were hiring and <br>
That's when I knew<br>
<br>
You saved me <i>[4x]</i><br>
<br>
Now i was 18 out there on the block<br>
Selling drugs<br>
With a gun at my waist<br>
And for people I had no love<br>
See the streets was my home<br>
Family and friends were all gone<br>
Had no one to trust<br>
And deep inside i was all alone<br>
And a deal went bad one day<br>
And it was enough to pause me<br>
I was shot 4 times and before i<br>
Knew it I was on my knees<br>
<br>
Blood pushin out my body<br>
My heart's beating faster don't know what i'm gonna do<br>
I don't think i'm gonna last then<br>
I begain to flash back on the things<br>
I done in my past<br>
Then I heard a small voice that said<br>
I'll give you peace if you believe<br>
I accepted Christ that day<br>
Halilujah now i'm free<br>
<br>
You saved me <i>[4x]</i><br>
<br>
I was in the aisle of the grocery store<br>
With a pain in my chest and I'm wondering<br>
Where did it come from (I got tested)<br>
And the results came back <br>
And the doctor said i'm sorry but u got cancer<br>
I could not beleive it so <br>
I call my mama to calm my nerves<br>
<br>
(mama) she got down on her knees<br>
(mama) she said a prayer for me<br>
(mama) just keep on thanking Jesus<br>
(mama) he'll give you what you need<br>
(thank you Jesus)<br>
Now that was five years ago<br>
I don't have that pain no more<br>
Doc said you can go home<br>
Cause all your cancer's gone<br>
<br>
You saved me <i>[4x]</i><br>
<br>
You saved me (said you saved me)<br>
You saved me (but you saved me)<br>
You saved me saaaved me<br>
Gave me a second chance (second chance)<br>
Halilujah saved me<br>
Saved me saved me<br>
Wooooooh You saved me<br>
<br>
You gave me it was by grace You saved me<br>
I'm so thankful that You looked down on me<br>
Saw me standing there<br>
I was at the end of my rope no where to go<br>
And you gave me<br>
<br>
No where to go (and you saved me)<br>
I was down and out 2 <br>
I was doing drugs 2<br>
I was running the streets 2<br>
Never felt love<br>
I was wilding out<br>
You saved me<br>
You stepped in ooh save me<br>
<br>
You saved me
Rock on, come on, come on<br>
Come on, come on, come on<br>
Chillin' at the club<br>
Showing niggas how we ball<br>
Ever since the drought<br>
It's been nothing but the trump<br>
<br>
Can you really blame me for getting these G's<br>
Something I don't understand<br>
Why you fools after me, VIP<br>
Got the haters after me<br>
Cuz I push these V's<br>
They wanna be like me<br>
If you agree<br>
Then raise the roof with me<br>
In the party place to be<br>
Living VIP<br>
<br>
Since when did money, oh<br>
Become such a problem<br>
I just wanna live a life<br>
That only involve the numbers, yeah<br>
<br>
Can you really blame me for getting these G's<br>
See what I can't understand<br>
Why you fools don't rock with me, VIP<br>
I got the haters after me <br>
Because I push these V's<br>
They wanna be like me<br>
If you agree (If you agree)<br>
Then raise the roof with me (Raise the roof with me)<br>

Ha ha, nothing but the<br>
Stretch Bentleys with the top thats drop, that's right<br>
Kelly CD's with the sound that knocks<br>
Di di di di di di di<br>

Fingers to the wrist filled with nothin but rocks<br>
I know you haters wanna come to Rockland's party<br>
But you can't get in unless you VIP<br>
<br>
Can you really blame me for getting these G's<br>
See what I can't understand<br>
Why you fools are after me, livin' V<br>
So if you're ballin' and you know, raise your hands<br>
And if you sexy and you know it, stomp your feet<br>
And if your man ain't spendin' money on you<br>
Then ladies, you can come and get with me<br>
A little V<br>
<br>
<i>[R]</i><br>
Yo, uh huh, wish I could call up all the haters<br>
I mean, I wish I could make a phone call <br>
To all the haters around the world<br>
You know what I'm saying?<br>
This is what I'd say<br>
What's goin' on in the world today, huh?<br>
Seems like every nigga got beef cuz they ain't got steak <br>
When I ain't had no money see, everything was cool<br>
But now that I got a little money and y'all wanna act a fool<br>
And none of 'em VIP<br>
<br>
VIP, I got the haters after me<br>
Because I push these V's (What?)<br>

<i>[1]</i> - To all my players and my thugs<br>
To all my honeys in the club<br>
To all the hoods that show me love<br>
We ride, we ride<br>

To all my ballers lockin' ice, getting a room for the night<br>
Taking first class flights, we ride, we ride<br>
(From Chitown to LA)<br>
<br>
<i>[Noreaga]</i><br>
Yo, I used to be in Chitown and collect panties<br>

Thugged out yo, all my people givin' eye jammies<br>
Now them shorties say I'm cute, when they can't stand me<br>
R. Kelly yo, I'm right from the belly, you know the soul<br>
Everything that we spit on is platinum gold<br>
But now it's for the love, for all the players and the thugs<br>
Yo, it's a party goin' on, meet me right at the club<br>
We got some chickens in the living room getting it on<br>
And they ain't leaving 'till six in the morning<br>
Thugged out, my people gettin' head while we on and<br>

Gun up in your waist, please don't shoot up the place<br>

Money makers got my thug niggas watchin' my rear for player haters<br>
Eighteen and I'm livin' a dream, go figure<br>
How a nigga that's younger than you, ice bigger<br>
Don't sweat that, stick to rap nigga, try that<br>
Call my nigga R. Kell if you need a hit, black<br>
And when you get it, make it known baby, who did it<br>
It'll make your fans hit the stores and go get it<br>
Now, here come a bitter sweet note for the fellas<br>
Left out the club with her friend, now she jealous<br>
Mad cuz she can't ride in the LS<br>
Yeah, she kinda mad but a baller could care less<br>
While you sleep, sleep, sleep<br>

So let's ride to Rockland's party, uh huh<br>
<br>
<i>[Jay-Z]</i><br>
Check, Ghetto pro' federal<br>
Jay-Z shake the dice, let 'em go<br>
Bet a load I tear down every show<br>
Better know cheddar crowed like the front babe row<br>
Says R., Jay y'all, all I need is four bars<br>
I'm hotter than a lotta men<br>
Switch up cars like Rodman's hair color, then hit your broad<br>
I'm borderline too much for the mortal mind<br>
Every time you ought to rewind, find there's more to find <br>
Now pop that cork, then pour the wine<br>
Represent New York to Chitown, like what<br>
Floss mine, like of course my, what<br>
Never cross my family, can we all get along? Hell no<br>
I'm tryin' to tell y'all who dat is that rule that biz<br>
Not your baby daddy but Jay-Z, true that is<br>
Better school that kid on who's shoes that is<br>
Or who I be nigga, V.I.P Jigga<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
<i>[R.]</i><br>
Let's get together and make this loot<br>
(Trackmasters, Rockland)<br>
Make this loot<br>
(Untertainment)<br>
Come on players<br>
(Thugged out)<br>
Come on players<br>
(And we out like that)<br>
Rock-a-fella ya'll
I'm sick and tired of the games you played<br>
Every move I make your ass got something to say<br>
Scandalize my name when you see it in the paper<br>
Trying to turn it all around when it wasn't that way<br>
Everybody is trying to figure me out<br>
What the hell is wrong with y'all just let me live my life<br>
I can't go one day without y'all in my face<br>
Y'all done lost y'all minds if you don't hear what I say<br>
Cops chase me when I'm standing still<br>
You know I ain't done shit wrong so why you want me in your cell<br>
You don't like my songs well it pays the bills<br>
And you cut me down cuz I keep it real<br>
Sometimes I wanna fly far away from here<br>
To another place it ain't worth these tears<br>
Sometimes at night when I close my eyes<br>
I know the haters are busy making up hater lies<br>
Sometimes I laugh trying to keep from crying<br>
If I was plain out of love then tell me who could I trust<br>
See I work so hard just to get ahead<br>
If it wasn't for God I'd probably be dead<br>
Sometimes I think y'all trying to pull me down<br>
But y'all wasting your time I got you haters figured out<br>
If yo had your way it'd be lock and key<br>
Everywhere I go trouble follows me<br>
Where the hell is my father shit it hurts sometimes<br>
There's a hole in me and it rocks my mind<br>
<br>
Forgive me father for I have sinned<br>
When was your last confession<br>
<br>
His true fears he left without a care<br>
And that was more than I could bare<br>
When you need my help I never tell you no<br>
When I need your love you got somewhere to go<br>
I'm getting sick of this shit but I'm not gonna quit<br>
I've come too far gotta keep my pockets thick<br>
I get mad as hell but that's ok<br>
Kick off these shoes cuz I'm here to stay<br>
I gotta let you know got no time to play<br>
So feel me and all that you hear me say<br>
What I'm building up you can't tear it down<br>
Cuz it's built on solid Rockland ground<br>
We don't die, we multiply, hit after hit, living platinum style<br>
Keep my head up high, looking toward the sky<br>
Nothing inmy view, hey I can fly<br>
Y'all just hate, I can't take no more<br>
And if you feel me raise your hand and show<br>
<br>
This is what I feel, ooh, this is what I feel<br>
Feel me, feel me, feel me, hey, hey feel, woo<br>
Westside tell me can you feel me, hey, oh<br>
Eastside tell me can you feel me, whoa, oh south<br>
Southside tell me can you feel me<br>
Feel me, feel me
I'm standing here looking in the mirror<br>
Saying "damn" to myself<br>
I should have known the day would come<br>
That she would find somebody else<br>
And all the things I took her through <br>
Shit, I shouldn't have lasted this long<br>
Now I'm at this telephone booth calling Tyrone<br>
<br>
<i>[1]</i> - Cuz when a woman's fed up<br>
(No matter how you beg, no)<br>
It ain't nothing you can do about it<br>
(Nothing you can do about it)<br>
It's like running out of love<br>
(No matter what you say, no)<br>
And then it's too late to talk about it<br>
(Too late to talk about it)<br>
<br>
Now let's talk about how it all goes down<br>
I used to make love to you daily<br>
When the night fell the same<br>
And anytime that you were hurt<br>
I could feel your pain<br>
And if I had a dollar<br>
It was yours, yeah<br>
And whenever we would go out<br>
I would front the bill <br>
But now the up is down<br>
And the silence is sound<br>
I hurt you too too many times<br>
Now I can't come around<br>
<br>

If you don't want to find out the hard way<br>
Then listen to this song while the record plays<br>

<br>
You can cry a river <br>
'Till an ocean starts to form, yeah<br>
But she will always remember <br>
Cuz she's a woman scorned<br>
And if you ever get her back<br>
It will never be the same<br>
She's cuttin' the corners of her eyes<br>
Every time she see your face<br>
Now your trust is out the door<br>
She don't want you no more<br>
You used to tell your boys, not me<br>
And she would always be there for you<br>
If you had took the time to see <br>
What that woman meant to you<br>
Is what the mirror said to me, whoa<br>
She was raised in Illinois <br>
Right outside of Chicago<br>
Some of the best cookin' you ever had<br>
Yes, it was and I miss her<br>
Hey woman, if you're listening<br>
I said I miss you baby
When I wake up in the morning time and see the sun I say<br>
Hallelujah, thank you Jesus for waking me up today<br>
I think about his goodness and the wonderful things he's done;<br>
Forgiving me, setting me free and casting my sins away<br>
And soon as I was about to fall you stepped right in on time<br>
Picked me up, and let me know you had nothing but love for me<br>
And those lonely nights when I thought that I gonna lose my mind (my mind)<br>
Lord, You were my company<br>
<br>
And now I feel joy (when I think about you)<br>
I feel strength (when I think about you)<br>
No pain (when I think about you)<br>
And no rain (when I think about you)<br>
I get glad (when I think about you)<br>
And raise my hands (when I think about you)<br>
Shout your name (when I think about you)<br>
(When I think about you)<br>
<br>
And in the midst of the storm you were the shelter in my life<br>
Even though (I was doing wrong) and even though (I fell off)<br>
No-one can help me out, the way you helped me whenever I was in need<br>
When trouble was chasing, I was weak (mmm) you kept your hands on me<br>
My God you sacrifised you life that I might live for eternity<br>
Despite my faults, you heard my cry (yes you did) and forgave my inequity<br>
No-one can understand, the way you understand when it comes to my heart<br>
Lord you gave me a brand new start<br>
<br>
And now I feel joy (when I think about you)<br>
Feel strength (when I think about you)<br>
There is no pain (when I think about you)<br>
No rain (when I think about you)<br>
I get glad (when I think about you)<br>
Raise my hands (when I think about you)<br>
And shout your name (when I think about you) Oh Lord<br>
(When I think about you)<br>
<br>
Listen<br>
Even though your doubts will come (doubts will come)<br>
Believe he gave his only son (all of the world) to all the world<br>
He chose to love (oh, yes he did) so how can we not (how can we not) send our praises up<br>
<br>
I feel joy (when I think about you)<br>
Feel strength, yeah (when I think about you)<br>
There's no rain (when I think about you)<br>
No more pain (when I think about you)<br>
I get glad, ohh (when I think about you)<br>
Then I raise my hands (when I think about you)<br>

I was just mindin my business when<br>
Ms. Prety you came walking<br>
My heart stopped said what is this just<br>
As soon as you started talking<br>
Something happened deep within me (well)<br>
All of a sudden I got this feeling<br>
A chill came from feet to head and then I<br>
Turned away from you and said to myself<br>
This is not supposed to happen brother you’ve been hurt too many times before<br>
First I tripped, then I slipped, then I fell<br>
<br>
You made me love you<br>
You made me love you babe, made me love you babe<br>
Made me love you babe, (oh Lord) made me love you babe<br>

Made me love you babe, (said it wasn’t in my plans) made me love you babe<br>
Ooh, look at you<br>
<br>
Said you must be one of the top models<br>
Body curved like a pop bottle<br>
Got me sweating like a boxer baby<br>
I done stumbled up on a perfect lady (awww)<br>
Could this be what heaven sent to me<br>
An angel come to set me free<br>
Love has been a stranger to me<br>
And myself keeps telling me that<br>
This is not supposed to happen brother you’ve been hurt too many times before<br>
First I tripped, then I slipped, then I fell<br>
<br>
You made me love you<br>
You made me love you babe, (oh yes) made me love you babe<br>
Made me love you babe, (hoo) made me love you babe<br>
Hey you made me love you<br>

Are 10 billion wonders to me (like the moon and stars above)<br>
There’s a whole new world for my eyes to see (yes sir)<br>
So much joy darling you put in me<br>
And now the sun is shining where there used to be rain, oh Lord<br>
And now no more loneliness, no more hurt, no more pain<br>
<br>
You made whoo!<br>

And now that you've come around, to seein' it my way<br>

<i>[1]</i> - My Body's callin' for you<br>
My Body's callin' for You<br>

Show you how you should feel, baby<br>
Oh So we speak now and forever hold your body<br>
Whatever it is you want from me, baby<br>

Knowing your body wants something<br>
And it's easy for me to see <br>
That your body's callin' for me<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>

<br>
<i>[Repeat 1 until fade out]</i>
You remind me of something<br>
I just can't think of what it is<br>
<br>
<i>[1]</i> - You remind me of my jeep, I wanna ride it<br>
Something like my sound, I wanna pump it<br>
Girl you look just like my cars, I wanna wax it<br>
And something like my bank account<br>
I wanna spend it, baby<br>
<br>
It's something about your love that's got me going crazy<br>
Baby, you know I want you real bad<br>
And girl I really like your freaky style<br>
How can I be down with you?<br>
So get a little closer to my ride<br>
I wanna get to know you lady<br>
And hip me up on how to get inside you<br>
Listen, pretty baby<br>
<br>
<i>[2]</i> - I wanna roll it, roll it, roll it, roll it<br>
Is all I wanna do for you baby<br>
Girl, it's something kind of sexy<br>
Goin' on about you babe<br>
<i>[repeat 1, 1]</i><br>
<br>
Now I would like to take you on a ride tonight<br>
Girl, you know we'll have so much fun<br>
And give you everything your body needs<br>
Satisfaction guaranteed<br>
So pull up to my bumper and let the system sound<br>
Girl, I bet cha' I can drive you crazy<br>
And let me be the one to drop you off<br>
Babe, listen to me<br>
<i>[rpt 2, 1, 1...1]</i><br>
<br>
Don't be alone, don't be alone<br>
I'm comin' through your door<br>
Turn off the lights, turn off the lights, baby<br>
It's something about this moment<br>
<i>[rpt 1, 1, 1...]</i>
Everyday and night I pray <br>
Love will swing you back this way<br>
Life without you here with me <br>
Ain't the same without you G<br>
<br>
Baby hear me, I never meant to hurt you<br>
Baby come and talk to me<br>
Let me know what's on your mind<br>
Every time I see you<br>
You're running from me all the time<br>
<br>
Baby hear me, I never meant to hurt you<br>
I only wanted you to be happy<br>
You to have the best of things<br>
To be down with me, baby<br>
'Cause your lovin', it's so good<br>
<br>
You're giving me the run-around<br>
Thought our love was going down<br>
Baby don't you know<br>
That I'm down until the day I die<br>
Baby hear me, never meant to hurt you<br>
Now you know I'll never do anything to hurt you<br>
'Cause baby I love you<br>
<br>
Every night and day I pray<br>
Your love returns<br>
Oh I'd give my life<br>
If it would only make you happy<br>
<br>
<i>[Rap (Notorious B.I.G)]</i><br>
Sittin' reminiscin' on when you started dissin'<br>
Spittin' in faces in public places<br>
Rolexes with faces had you chipper for months<br>
Made some dough, did some shows, now you're starting to front<br>
Smokin' blunts on the veranda with Amanda<br>
She's fillin' your head with he said, she said<br>
Poppa doin' this, Poppa doin' that<br>
But don't tell him I said it 'cause my Jeep might get wetted<br>
Forget it, go on take her word like the Koran<br>
Ya'll stay friends, I'll stay and smoke Phil Benzs<br>
I regret Putting you on to Bagguettes.<br>
Honeysuckle sets, Biggie secret pyjama sets<br>
You were the Reebok vandal, now you were Chanel sandals<br>
I made you - why would I play you?<br>
Think about it while the streets you roam<br>
It's all peas and crispies in the fridge when you get home<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
You to be, be happy<br>
You to have the best of things<br>
Baby everything you want it for baby<br>
You to be down with me<br>
So give me that ass back baby<br>
'Cause your lovin' is so good, so damn good, babe<br>
<br>
Everyday and night I pray love will swing you back this way<br>
Life without you here with me ain't the same without you G<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
