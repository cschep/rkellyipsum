Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
Playas get lonely too, too
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
Playas get lonely too, too
From my iPhone to my sidekick Jet planes, schedule hectic My love life, I
neglect it Had a fast car but I wrecked it
Plenty chances to fall in love, man So many weekends I went to clubs, man In
the fast lane my life's a picture flick Let my drink decide who is the next
chick
I ain't gone lie, on the plane it don't matter to me She say she me love me but
it's just chit chatter to me But deep inside I was always missing something But
I'm a thug so I'm always on something
So many girls always drinking and having fun Life's a beauty shop and I keep my
hair done Seems like I'm on a merry-go-round And it make a thug wanna settle
down
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes Playas get lonely too, too Sometimes,
sometimes, sometimes Playas get lonely too, too
Im gonna settle down with you, baby you and me A life that's brand new, quit
running these streets Take away your pain, chase away the rain Off my love
game, I might even change my name
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes Playas get lonely too, too Sometimes,
sometimes, sometimes Playas get lonely too, too
Uh, uh V.I.P., uh, uh R O B Always in the spot light Living the good life All
of that, somethin still just ain't right
Videos and all of these interviews When all I really want is to be next to you
I spend more time with my car now Land of the Hollywood sign, I'm a star now
My life is more than the cars and awards It gets lonely and I can't ignore
Always in the streets going hardcore I spend a couple of G's when I'm bored
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes Playas get lonely too, too Sometimes,
sometimes, sometimes Playas get lonely too, too
Party nights mixed with lonely nights Mixed with first class flights mixed with
Uh, nobody to share it with, no
Above all after parties I still need somebody To be there when a playas going
through some shit To be there when a playa can't ever see
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes Playas get lonely too, too Sometimes,
sometimes, sometimes Playas get lonely too, too
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes Playas get lonely too, too Sometimes,
sometimes, sometimes Playas get lonely too, too
Playas get lonely R O B, 12 play 4th quarter
