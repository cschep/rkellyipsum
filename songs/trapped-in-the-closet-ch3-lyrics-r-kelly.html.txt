Here we are, the four of us
In total shock, me and her
I closed my mouth and swallowed spit
And I'm thinking to myself, "This is some deep shit"
And I said, "So you're gonna tell me He's the one he's been talking to?" He
says, "Yes", I say, "No", he says, "Yes" I say, "No", he says, "It's the truth"

I said, "All of y'all ass is crazy, let me up out this door Because this is way
more than I bargained for" She says, "Wait, I'm sure we can all fix this" Then
I said, "I'm late, plus I ain't gotta damn thing to do with this"
But then she said, "Wouldn't you just like to know how it all began?" Then I
thought to myself and said, Quick, you got three minutes Then it got real
quiet, I said, "Somebody start talking" She said, "My God, Rufus, I've got just
one question
How could you do something like this? I'm so hurt" He looked at her and said,
"Bitch, please, you've got your nerves With all your club hopping, lying when
you said you was shopping And now here you are in our home and you're calling
me wrong"
She said, "Okay, you busted me and that much I agree You caught me cheating but
this is a little extreme" He said, "You are my wife, sleeping behind my back
And now I come home and you got him in the closet How extreme is that?"
And she said, "But she's a he" And he said, "Please, you can't judge me" She
said, "But Rufus this is crazy" And I said, "Stop arguing I did not stay here
to hear you chew each other out So get to the point or I swear I'm out"
"Excuse me, please but I think I can explain What's going on in here My name is
Chuck and I been knowing Rufus about a year At midnight creeping around with
him has been a living hell Sneaking in and out of hotels" I said, "Brother,
spare the details"
Then Rufus said, "Chuck, please, don't say nothing else" Then she screams,
"Rufus, you son of a bitch" He says, "Cathy, go to hell" I said, "I thought you
said your name was Mary That what you said at the party Man, this is getting
scary, I'ma shoot somebody"
Then Rufus start yelling and screaming saying "Cathy, this is all your fault"
She throws a pillow at him and says, "You were creeping too The only difference
is you didn't get caught" Chuck screamed out, "We're in love" Cathy says,
"Love, my ass" Rufus said they're getting married then I shoot one in the air
I said, "Not another one of you sons of bitches say a word 'Cuz all this shit
I'm going through is unheard" I grabbed my cellular, I said, "This is so
wrong", I call up my home And a man picks up the phone, phone, phone, phone
