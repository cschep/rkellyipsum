What's up baby?
I know what you're thinking
What did I call you over here for?
I wanna take you somewhere
Tempo slow, lights down low Let me take you to a place Where only love grooves
go
Step into my territory and let the vibes begin Don't be afraid, just let this
love groove in Let the passion lead you to a place beyond Exploring my bedroom,
having freaky fun
Tempo slow, lights down low Let me take you to a place Where only love grooves
go
Where all the players go And all the gangstas go
Tempo slow, lights down low Let me take you to a place Where only love grooves
go
Rules they are so simple, so very simple As our bodies connect and those juices
start to flow Makin' sweet love till the morning light And satisfying love's
appetite
Tempo slow, lights down low Let me take you to a place Where only love grooves
go
Where all the players go And all the gangstas go
Tempo slow, lights down low Let me take you to a place Where only love grooves
go
Oh baby, ooh, tell daddy what it is you want Come on and unravel those little
secrets unknown Time to taste what love has in store for me So let's take a sip
of this love groove chemistry
Tempo slow, lights down low Let me take you to a place Where only love grooves
go
Where all the players go And all the gangstas go
Tempo slow, lights down low Let me take you to a place Where only love grooves
go
Where all the players go And all the gangstas go
Tempo slow, lights down low Let me take you to a place Where only love grooves
go
Where all the players go And all the gangstas go
