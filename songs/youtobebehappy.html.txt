Everyday and night I pray <br>
Love will swing you back this way<br>
Life without you here with me <br>
Ain't the same without you G<br>
<br>
Baby hear me, I never meant to hurt you<br>
Baby come and talk to me<br>
Let me know what's on your mind<br>
Every time I see you<br>
You're running from me all the time<br>
<br>
Baby hear me, I never meant to hurt you<br>
I only wanted you to be happy<br>
You to have the best of things<br>
To be down with me, baby<br>
'Cause your lovin', it's so good<br>
<br>
You're giving me the run-around<br>
Thought our love was going down<br>
Baby don't you know<br>
That I'm down until the day I die<br>
Baby hear me, never meant to hurt you<br>
Now you know I'll never do anything to hurt you<br>
'Cause baby I love you<br>
<br>
Every night and day I pray<br>
Your love returns<br>
Oh I'd give my life<br>
If it would only make you happy<br>
<br>
<i>[Rap (Notorious B.I.G)]</i><br>
Sittin' reminiscin' on when you started dissin'<br>
Spittin' in faces in public places<br>
Rolexes with faces had you chipper for months<br>
Made some dough, did some shows, now you're starting to front<br>
Smokin' blunts on the veranda with Amanda<br>
She's fillin' your head with he said, she said<br>
Poppa doin' this, Poppa doin' that<br>
But don't tell him I said it 'cause my Jeep might get wetted<br>
Forget it, go on take her word like the Koran<br>
Ya'll stay friends, I'll stay and smoke Phil Benzs<br>
I regret Putting you on to Bagguettes.<br>
Honeysuckle sets, Biggie secret pyjama sets<br>
You were the Reebok vandal, now you were Chanel sandals<br>
I made you - why would I play you?<br>
Think about it while the streets you roam<br>
It's all peas and crispies in the fridge when you get home<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i><br>
You to be, be happy<br>
You to have the best of things<br>
Baby everything you want it for baby<br>
You to be down with me<br>
So give me that ass back baby<br>
'Cause your lovin' is so good, so damn good, babe<br>
<br>
Everyday and night I pray love will swing you back this way<br>
Life without you here with me ain't the same without you G<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus]</i>
