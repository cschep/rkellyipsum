Yeah I know, y'know, what a calling is
I mean we all have a calling in our life, I believe
You know I'm from the dirt, man
I come up in these streets, went without eatin'
You know what I'm sayin'?
Saw my mom go without eatin' I got tired of that I had to go out there In them
streets and hustle, you know? I mean you know what I'm sayin'?
I mean it's easy for y'all to say, y'know Surrender your life, you know what
I'm sayin'? Give your life to God and all that Y'know, that's good and I
believe in God But when you got bills at your front door all the time You know
what I'm sayin'?
Kids screamin' "Daddy, Momma, where the food at?" Man it makes it kinda hard to
believe in Y'know, and have faith in something that you can't see Even though
you wanna believe Y'all just gonna have to just pray for me You know what I'm
sayin'? 'Cause uh
Constantly my mind and my heart is racing All by myself trying to solve all of
these problems I'm facing Looking to man, trying to find hope But man will
never know the depth of my struggles
I was depending on myself to give myself a hand But when depending on myself
fell and time again And that's why I'm standing here alone with no one else
Lord I realized that I can't fight these battles by myself
I surrender, I surrender, I surrender to You, Lord I surrender, I surrender, I
surrender to You, Lord I surrender, I surrender, I surrender to You, Lord
Coming out with both hands up, I surrender
Listen, I tried everything I could to make it work But everything I seemed to
try just made it worse And every road that I'd go down there were no signs
Destination lonely with no peace of mind
I was depending on myself to give myself a hand But when depending on myself
fell and time again And that's why I'm standing here alone with no one else
Lord I realized that I can't fight these battles by myself, I surrender
I surrender, I surrender, I surrender to you, Lord I surrender, I surrender, I
surrender to you, Lord I surrender, I surrender, I surrender to you, Lord
Coming out with both hands up, I surrender
Won't you guard the place around it? There's nowhere for me to go Joy I have
tried to find, see I've searched high and I've searched low Said you walked
throughout the building So come and rescue me from this hell 'cause I can't do
it by myself
I surrender, I surrender, I surrender to you, Lord I surrender, I surrender, I
surrender to you, Lord I surrender, I surrender, I surrender to you, Lord I
surrender, I surrender, I surrender to you, Lord
I surrender, I surrender, I surrender to you, Lord I surrender, I surrender, I
surrender to you, Lord I surrender, I surrender, I surrender to you, Lord I
surrender, I surrender
