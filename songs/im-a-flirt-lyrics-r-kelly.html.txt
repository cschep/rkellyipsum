Im a, Im a, Im a, Im a flirt
Soon as I see her walk up in the club Im a flirt
Winkin eyes at me when I roll up on them dubs Im a flirt
Sometimes when I'm with my chick on the low Im a flirt
And when she's with her man lookin at me damn right Im a flirt
So homie don't bring your girl to meet me cause Im a flirt And baby don't
bring your girlfriend to eat cause Im a flirt Please believe it unless your
game is tight and you trust her Then don't bring her 'round me because Im a
flirt
Now I swear to tell the truth and the whole truth When it comes to those I be
pimpin like I supposed to Rollin like I supposed to, shinin like I supposed
to In the club freakin with honeys like I supposed to
I don't understand when a player bring his girlfriend to the club Freakin out
on the flo' with his girlfriend in the club And wonderin' why all these players
tryin' to holla at her Just soon as she go to the bathroom player Im gon

A dog on the prowl when I'm walkin through the mall If I could man, I probably
would flirt with all of y'all Yeah yeah homey, you say she your girlfriend But

them playerette flirters in the Chi Now the moral of story is cuff yo' chick
Cause hey, I'm black, handsome, I sing, plus I'm rich And Im a flirt
