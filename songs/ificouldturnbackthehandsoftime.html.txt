How did I ever let you slip away<br>
Never knowing I'd be singing this song some day<br>
And now I'm sinking, sinking to rise no more<br>
Ever since you closed the door<br>
<br>
<i>[1]</i> - If I could turn, turn back the hands of time<br>
Then my darlin' you'd still be mine<br>
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time<br>
Then darlin' you, you'd still be mine<br>
<br>
Funny, funny how time goes by<br>
And blessings are missed in the wink of an eye<br>
Why oh why oh why should one have to go on suffering<br>
When every day I pray please come back to me<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
And you had enough love for the both of us<br>
But I, I, I did you wrong, I admit I did<br>
But now I'm facing the rest of my life alone, whoa<br>
<br>
<i>[Repeat 1]</i><br>
<br>
I'd never hurt you (If I could turn back)<br>
Never do you wrong (If I could turn back)<br>
And never leave your side (If I could turn back)<br>
If I could turn back the hands<br>
<br>
There'd be nothing I wouldn't do for you <br>
(If I could turn back)<br>
Forever honest and true to you<br>
(If I could turn back)<br>
If you accept me back in your heart, I love you<br>
(If I could turn back the hands)<br>
<br>
(If I could turn back)<br>
That would be my will<br>
(If I could turn back)<br>
Darlin' I'm begging you to take me by the hands<br>
(If I could turn back the hands)<br>
<br>
I'm going down, yes I am <br>
(If I could turn back)<br>
Down on my bended knee, yeah<br>
(If I could turn back)<br>
And I'm gonna be right there until you return to me<br>
(If I could turn back the hands)<br>
<br>
(If I could turn back)<br>
If I could just turn back that little clock on the wall<br>
(If I could turn back)<br>
Then I'd come to realize how much I love you <br>
Love you love you love you<br>
(If I could turn back the hands)
