Out of all the girls I've loved before
Out of all the stages I've performed on
Out of all of the cities I've been to
I bless the day that I found you
I bless the day I found you And that's my word It's nothing for me Out there in
those streets
You took my heart And you set it on fire And now my love forever burns You keep
taking me higher
I've been looking for love In all the wrong places And now I finally found
Someone who cares for me
No matter the storm It was you who helped me face it And now it's safe to say
That you really care for me
Just like the wings, you took me, flew me away, yeah And now my ground Is
underneath my feet
This man had nowhere to go Then you gave me direction And now the rest of my
days I can't help but give you the praise
I've been looking for love In all the wrong places And now I finally found
Someone who cares for me
No matter the storm It was you who helped me face it And now it's safe to say
That you really care for me
You saw my needs, forgave my faults You cleansed my heart, you changed my
thoughts You brought the sun into my life When my world had seemed dark, yes
you did
And you're the only one Who was there when I needed a friend You're the only
one who can place joy When there's pain in my heart
I've been looking for love In all the wrong places And now I finally found
Someone who cares for me
No matter the storm It was you who helped me face it And now it's safe to say
That you really care for me
I've been looking for love In all the wrong places And now I finally found
Someone who cares for me
No matter the storm It was you who helped me face it And now it's safe to say
That you really care for me
I've been looking for love In all the wrong places
