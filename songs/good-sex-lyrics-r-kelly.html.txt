I can tell just by lookin' at yo body When you walk up in the club, girl That
you got good sex Even though I haven't test it Best believe that I can trust it
When I look at you That you got good sex And I'm tryin' to see what's dat like
When we leave this club tonight 'Cuz girl, I can tell That you got that good
sex So put yo hands up Ladies, put yo hands up If you got that good sex
